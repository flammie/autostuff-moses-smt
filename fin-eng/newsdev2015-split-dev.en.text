Changes in business support policies - Region - Areas - News - Karjalainen
In addition to EU support for businesses, also the administration of national business support will be concentrated in four Centres for Economic Development, Transport and Environment (ELY Centres), starting from mid-September.
The ELY Centre of Southern Savo in Mikkeli is responsible for the activity in eastern Finland.
According to the new business support law, which came into effect in the beginning of July, the EU’s Structural Funds support may not be applied to large companies any more, except in case of completely new activities.
The subsidiaries of the municipalities with over five thousand inhabitants will also be considered as large municipalities.
However, the EU support can be granted also in the future for investments that improve municipalities’ economy prerequisites.
The unit which will be administrating both EU and national support in eastern Finland will consist of approximately 30 persons.
At least for the time being, all of them will continue working at their current sites.
For example, the workplace of Mr Kalevi Pölönen, the head of the Structural Fund unit of the Southern Savo ELY Centre, is in Joensuu.
Researcher: this is what Russia aims at in Ukraine
Russia acts in a consistent manner, even though it always wouldn’t seem so.
Lecturer Torsti Siren, Lieutenant Colonel and the director of the Department of Strategic and Defence Studies of the National Defence University, wasn’t surprised by the ambivalent Ukraine news on Monday morning.
It has been the same stuff for a long time, Siren says.
On one side, we had Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov calling for an immediate ceasefire and declaring that Russia will not attack Ukraine. (Read more here.)
On the other side, we had Ukraine reporting that their paratroopers are currently fighting with a Russian tank unit near Luhansk airport, and that the tank unit has received reinforcements. (Read more here.)
Lavrov demands an unconditional ceasefire to be achieved at the talks in Minsk.
Russia denies being involved, and requires that an immediate negotiation outcome must be reached, so that they can establish their position in Luhansk and in Donetsk.
That’s the whole point, Siren says.
This is the big picture: you must start negotiating quickly, and especially so, that Russia will get a hold of the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.
Finnair outsources cabin services to a Norwegian company, employees laid off
Finnair will start buying cabin services from a Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation as subcontracted work.
In the first phase, the agreement concerns Finnair’s Hong Kong and Singapore routes, but the plan is to extend it later.
The outsourcing of the two routes will result in a reduction of approximately hundred employees in Finland, and it will be carried out through lay-offs in the first stage, the company told in its statement.
Moreover, the employment of approximately 80 Asian temporary workers will end when the routes will be outsourced.
Finnair told already in June that it is going to outsource the cabin services of approximately 20 routes during the next two years.
The company decided to opt for the outsourcing, after an agreement regarding the savings couldn’t be reached with the personnel.
The plan is to start the outsourcing during the first three months of next year.
According to the company the co-operation negotiations shall continue also with other partner candidates.
A study shows that the sleep disorders will multiply the risk of the nerve-originated back pain, i.e. sciatica pain, among the persons performing heavy duty shift work.
A study carried out by Finnish Institute of Occupational Health followed firefighters for 13 years.
The connection between the sleep disorders and the sciatica pain is surprisingly strong, even though several other factors were taken into account.
Firefighters’ good muscular strength and physical endurance, which are tested regularly, don’t seem to protect from pain, says lecturer Sirpa Lusa, the director of the research, in the statement from the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health.
The firefighters’ work is irregular shift work, and the shifts may be up to 24 hours long.
According to the Finnish Institute Occupational Health, the sleep disorders are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey, which was carried out in 1996, 1999, and 2009.
Are you aware of the new surprising reasons for water damages?
Easily cause damage in other apartments
Water damages A specialist from the Finnish Real Estate Management Federation reminds that the origin of a water damage is by no means always a leaking tube or a dripping tap.
We have been contacted when the breaking up of a fish tank has caused a water damage in the condominium, and we have been asked if it is possible to ban the fish tanks, says Marina Furuhjelm, the law specialist of the Finnish Real Estate Management Federation.
Ms Furuhjelm reminds that the tubes and drains alone aren’t the common causes for water damages, but nowadays also the new appliances, such as ice cube machines, have increasingly been causing water damages in the apartments.
Many aren’t aware that the appliances, such as dishwasher or laundry machine, must not be left turned on unattended.
Also the water tap must always be shut when the appliance is not on, because otherwise the pressure in the tubes may lead to a leak.
A dweller can be deemed negligent, if these obligations have been omitted, and in such cases the dweller is liable to pay the damages.
Of course, in such cases the home insurance may pay a compensation, depending on the insurance terms and on the case.
The dweller is liable to pay the damages, if it can be shown that the dweller’s negligent actions have caused the damages.
If the dweller has passed out in the shower covering the shower drain, the negligence can often be proved, because usually in these cases the water has flooded elsewhere, and the janitor enters the apartment in which the passed out dweller can be found.
Ms Furuhjelm tells that since the passing out on the shower drains has become so common, nowadays many student dormitories have two floor drains installed in the shower facilities.
Also waterbeds have caused water damages, albeit not as often as before, when they were more popular.
Even the tipping over of a dog’s water bowl or of a homemade wine container can result in serious water damages.
I also know about a case in which the many cats living in the apartment had been peeing on the floors so, that it caused great damages, says Ms Furuhjelm.
The principle of the liability to pay for the damages is always the same, unless the condominium statutes state otherwise.
The member is responsible for repairing the surface material and the damages in the condominium structure, as well as the damages caused to other apartments.
The water damages easily ruin other apartments, because the structure’s concrete absorbs water very easily.
Ms Furuhjelm says the heater leaks are especially troublesome, as the heaters easily leak into the structure insidiously.
The water damages can be caused by the air source heat pumps, which have become common nowadays, and which produce condensate water.
The water should be conducted to a fixed drain or rain water network, and not just into a container.
The member also has the responsibility of removing water, ice, and rubbish from the balcony, the law specialist advises.
Ms Furuhjelm instructs that even if the condominium rules don’t require for example a fixed outlet tube for the washing machine, the insurance terms may have a clause based on which the compensation will not be paid.
The home insurance terms and conditions should be read carefully.
However, I consider the loose washing machine water outlet tubes, that have been positioned for example in the bathtubs, a great risk, and they have caused several damages.
I recommend that the waste water would always be conducted in a fixed way into a sewage pipeline.
Removing snow and water from the balcony
Monitoring the washing machine, dishwasher, etc. when they are on.
Closing the water taps (of the washing machine and the dishwasher)
Cleaning of the visible parts of the floor drain twice in six months.
The recommendation is to connect the waste water in a fixed manner into the drain.
Checking the taps for possible leaks
Regular unfreezing of the freezer

FC Honka lost again and sank to the bottom of the series
The two currently weakest teams, according to Veikkausliiga league’s performance barometer, met on Sunday evening in Tapiola Sports Park.
FC Honka hasn’t won since June, and was now hosting Vaasan Palloseura, which has been proceeding steadily on a zero win path for seven matches in a row.
The last time VPS won, was exactly in a match against Honka in July.
The Sunday’s confrontation with the Espoo team surely happened at the right moment, as VPS returned finally to the win standard with the result 2-1.
Vaasa’s head coach Olli Huttunen lamented about the inefficiency of his team before the match, but Honka’s disorganized defence department eased VPS’s problems with scoring.
In terms of playing, it was a very nervous performance.
We didn’t manage to get any longer attacks at all, we couldn’t keep the ball,” Mr. Huttunen assessed the performance of his team.
In the first half, the centre-back pair Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played in a really uncertain manner.
Both goals scored by Vaasa’s team were result of the centre-backs’ slack playing.
The opening goal of the match was seen after five minutes only, when Steve Morrissey directed a shot from Sebastian Sandvall past Honka’s dumbfounded goalkeeper Walter Viitala.
The first half irritates me.
When the team went on the field, they did exactly the opposite as to what we had agreed before the game,” Honka’s head coach Shefki Kuqi darned.
After the initial shock, Espoo’s players got their playing together, and were then juggling the ball at the offensive end.
Especially the midfielder Carlos Portela and the winger Roni Porokara were eagerly searching for scoring opportunities, but the last solutions were nearly repeatedly miserable.
The player who got closest to scoring was the midfielder Jussi Vasara, whose shot from 20 metres eventually gravitated slightly past the VPS’s goal post.
VPS stroke back efficiently, taking advantage of their quick forwards and Honka’s bungling centre-back pair.
At thirty minutes, Vaasa’s team scored 2-0, when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart made a breakaway together.
Morrissey served and Steward finished.
In the opening period Morrissey was in a good playing mood, and he continuously created occasions from his left wing,
whereas Stewart’s speed seemed to be too much for Espoo’s defenders through entire match.
”I yelled them at the half-time, that if we’re going to lose, let’s lose with dignity,” Kuqi said.
Vexed Honka sought furiously a goal in the second half in order to narrow the result.
The team was close to scoring twice, until the third attempt succeeded.
The winger Yerai Vilaboa finished the goal from the middle of the penalty area.
After Vilaboa’s goal Honka had a half an hour to reach a draw.
Espoo’s team took greater and greater risks, which gave VPS opportunities to dangerous counter-attacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey got once in a face-to-face situation with Viitala, but the sharp stopping of Honka’s goalkeeper kept the home team in the game.
Towards the end Honka slightly ran out of steam, and didn’t manage to score any more.
Along with the defeat, Honka sank to the bottom of Veikkausliiga league, as there still are seven matches to go before the season ends.
Newspaper: Putin blustering about being able to take Kiev in two weeks
Russian President Vladimir Putin was rather harsh during his telephone conversation with the President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso, Italian newspaper La Repubblica reports.
Mr. Putin expressed his irritation regarding European Union’s plans to tighten the sanctions against Russia.
Mr. Putin said that if he wants to, he can take Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica reports.
According to La Repubblica, Mr. Putin’s message to Mr. Barroso was the following: It is not advisable to provoke Russia with new sanctions.
Mr. Putin gave an interview regarding the Ukraine crisis to the Russian Television’s Channel One on Sunday evening.
Mr. Putin told in the interview that he considers the conflict to be only Ukraine’s internal conflict, and encouraged Kiev government to negotiate directly with the insurgents.
At the same time he harshly warned Kiev about firing civil targets in eastern Ukraine.
Russia cannot just be an ”onlooker” if people are being shot dead at close range, Mr. Putin said.
Esko Roine confesses: working as an actor destroyed the family
Heavy-duty work Veteran actor and descendant of a theatre family confesses how working as an actor destroyed his first marriage.
Actor Esko Roine turns to 70 next Friday, but it’s probably safe to say that when it comes to him, the age is only a number.
I can’t tell any difference when I think about time one year back, or two years or ten years back.
The mental puberty seems to continue, Esko Roine says.
Mr. Roine retired years ago, but he still works hard, as if he was many men put together.
There used to be a joke that there aren’t many plays made in this country without Esko Roine.
Currently Mr. Roine has roles in Helsinki City Theatre play ”Miten menestyä vaivatta liike-elämässä”, in Tampere Workers’ Theatre play ”Mielensäpahoittaja” and Tampere Comedy Theatre play ”Kvartetti”.
Mr. Roine will also be seen in the upcoming Risto Räppääjä film.
PHOTO: Reijo Hietanen
Mr. Roine’s acting career didn’t have a promising start.
I wasn’t accepted for the Nativity play in the school.
40-50 years later the teacher told me it was because I was so lousy.
Esko Roine didn’t give up.
The career choice was clear, there weren’t any alternatives.
It felt familiar and dear.
I was in such hurry to get in the industry that I dropped out of school and volunteered for the army, so that I could apply for the theatre school as soon as possible.
Roine has had over 200 roles in theatre and he has done over 300 TV shows, depending a bit on how one calculates it.
If you count the jobs as the Englishmen do, that is counting each TV series episode as a show on its own, the total of the TV jobs amounts to 600.
I spent three years in ”Uusi päivä”, which had three episodes per week.
Two springs ago I was killed in it, because I hadn’t the time to do it.
Commitments until autumn 2016
Esko’s elder sisters Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full force, and they’re doing wild roles as anarchist grannies in Tampere Workers’ Theatre play ”Vielä ehtii”.
The younger brother will probably be still hanging out on stages for years to come.
That’s what it looks like now, but you never know when you’re talking about a chap of this age.
The condition “I’m in if I’ll be alive” applies.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
The calendar has bookings for the autumn 2016.
The years have also left their marks on the man.
The age has some collateral effects.
The knees have been operated, the hip whistles and osteoarthritis bothers, but as long as you don’t let it bother too much, you can get along, Esko Roine says.
TV audience remembers Mr. Roine for example from
Merirosvoradio and from a quiz in which he, together with Antti Einiö, gave away ”benknotes”, banknotes worth one hundred marks.
It was Antti Einiö who gave away ”benknotes”.
I tried to insist that they are banknotes and not benknotes.
In the TV series ”Reinikainen” Mr. Roine was the self-important inspector Rautakallio.
He became the favorite of the policemen in Tampere, as it turned out that the police department had an inspector similar to him.
A policeman once stopped me on the street, lowered the side window and shouted to me: ”That Rautakallio is fantastic!”
Right workgroup
From theatre works Mr. Roine remembers especially works such as
Helsinki City Theatre plays ”Producer” and ”Mestariluokka”, Tampere Workers’ Theatre play ”Kauppamatkustajan kuolema” and Tampere Theatre play ”Pitkän päivän matka yöhön”.
A common element among those works is that they all have been popular.
I can’t take the credit for it, it’s the workgroup that has succeeded.
There have been some low points too.
The role of Pekka Puupää in a feature film is one of those.
There are also others.
The reason is that I’ve agreed to do them too easily.
I don’t know if I regret those roles or not, but the result doesn’t satisfy neither me nor the audience.
As a rank-and-file actor you don’t get to choose your works.
You just are a nice boy and do what you’re told.
On the side of theatre works Mr. Roine has also sought success in business.
In the 80s he ran a restaurant called ”Wanhat Roomeot” in Tampere.
It was an instructive experience.
It didn’t work out at all when I simultaneously tried to be the executive director of Tampere Theatre, an actor, and then also a restaurateur.
If I remember correctly, it became clear in one year that these tasks aren’t compatible in any way.
The typical situation was when the performance was about to end, or the interval had started, and I already had been thinking of turning the sauna on, when I received a call from the restaurant, and I was told that my friends had popped in and were hoping to see me after the performance.
Memoirs on the occasion of the birthday
Esko Roine’s memoirs will be released on his birthday. Ghostwriters Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen have written the book.
Well, they’ve managed to cobble up some kind of product out of the memories of a facemaker.
Namely, when I used to play in Zoom I was called The Facemaker.
They didn’t know me by name at all.
The book has been in the making for years.
Mr. Roine already told long time ago that there will be no scoops, because he hasn’t done anything so wild, or if he has, he won’t tell it.
I wrote a little opening statement for the book.
I’m saying in it that if someone is waiting for revelations packed with scandals or good gossip, it is better to stop reading there and then.
It contains pretty much stuff related to my profession, both as an actor and as a theatre director.
The publisher boasts that there are some stories about hilarious times at the theatre school in the book.
It was quite normal student life, but I must admit that when I was a kid I did all kinds of stuff.
It wasn’t as wild when Turkka was the director.
It was very different.
I don’t know how much I got out of it, except for the self-confidence that when I’ve finished the school, I know that I can’t blame that, if my actions won’t get any better.
You didn’t have to think, oh how good I would be if I only had gone to school.
Mr. Roine also remembers the legends of the National Theatre.
I became friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Manni, and Hannes Häyrinen, and got to work with them.
There were several legends, starting from my first father-in-law Kaarlo Halttunen.
We were very close with Pia Hattara.
Tauno Palo is not with us any more, but I managed to get to know him when I was in school.
Palo’s second son Martti was on the same course with me.
At the theatre school Mr. Roine met his first wife Marjukka Halttunen.
The divorce is a painful thing for him to remember.
After a relatively long battle the children were split.
Not in halves, but the daughter went to the mother, and I got the son.
I didn’t think it was a good solution, and as far as I can see the children more or less agree now that they’re adults.
It is not rare in the theatre circles that the bonds of matrimony end up being dissolved.
In my case it had something to do with the fact that I was working quite a lot also back then.
I was in nearly every production.
Then there were the TV and radio works on top of that.
I was working long hours and the family life suffered because of it.
Possibly an evening off on the big day
Esko Roine will celebrate at Tampere Workers’ Theatre with the play ”Mielensäpahoittaja” on September 7th.
The celebrations will continue in Helsinki City Theatre on September 21st and 28th.
”Mielensäpahoittaja” (”I don’t like to complain, but”) is whining there also.
I was working when I turned fifty and also when I turned sixty.
As such an easily movable play landed in my hands, I thought well, let’s celebrate also the 70th birthday, so that we’ll be done with all that in a blast.
Mr. Roine says there will be no celebrations on the actual birthday.
I seem to remember that it will be an evening off, but I can’t be sure.
I might have booked myself a gig for that day.
Or then I’ll have a strange evening off, which I’m going to keep as an evening off, Mr. Roine says.
Aerospace groups voice concerns over supply chain
Some of Britain's smaller aerospace companies have expressed concern that capacity issues in the supply chain could derail the big aircraft makers' ambitious plans to step up production of passenger jets.
The thousands of companies that make up the UK's aerospace supply chain are at present benefiting from the launch of an unprecedented number of new aircraft and engine programmes under development in the industry simultaneously.
IN Aerospace & Defence
But while many are celebrating the strong backlog of orders, some have warned that the supply chain is already facing capacity constraints and price pressures.
"There is definitely cost pressure and that's coming now with the challenge of volume that is there," says Craig Gallagher, chief executive officer at MB Aerospace, a key supplier to aero-engine manufacturers, such as Rolls-Royce.
David Bailey, chief executive of the North West Aerospace Alliance, which represents about 240 aerospace suppliers across the North West of England, says more capacity is needed.
Have we got the strategies and investment plans in line with these growth plans?
I'm not sure to be honest.
What we need to see is investment in new capital equipment and machines that are required to meet these rates," he says.
Some companies say part of the problem is the coincidence of new programmes coming to market and an increase in build rates.
Andrew Churchill, managing director of JJ Churchill, a gas turbine blade manufacturer, says his company has gone through a "challenging time" after a series of programmes were simultaneously started at the beginning of this year.
We went from a position of being quite substantially under capacity to over capacity in the blink of an eye.
We went through a period of extensive arrears and trying to catch up.
But explaining that it's the compression of programmes that's created a problem doesn't win you any brownie points," Mr Churchill says.
JJ Churchill is dealing with the increase in production by investing in £800,000 worth of new machinery and recruiting an additional 26 staff.
Many in the industry believe there needs to be further investment and consolidation among the smaller operators if the UK is to maintain its position as the second - after the US - largest in the aerospace sector.
Geoff Ford, chairman of Ford Aerospace, a Tyneside-based precision engineer, says the backlog of orders should give suppliers the confidence to expand and increase capacity because the work will be there.
"If we don't do that we'll lose out to other countries," Mr Ford says.
Some bigger operators are trying to address the problem by acquiring capacity.
Senior, the FTSE 250 company that makes aerostructures and engine parts, this year paid £75m to buy UPECA, a Malaysian-based aerospace component manufacturer.
MB Aerospace has acquired businesses in North America and Poland over the past year.
"You can do greenfield start-ups, but in essence the real constraint is the engineering capability and capacity," Mr Gallagher of MB Aerospace says.
Both small and large suppliers say they are facing price pressures which are being cascaded down from the big aircraft makers and the aero-engine manufacturers.
However, some believe the worries over problems in the supply chain are being overplayed.
Marcus Bryson, head of GKN's aerospace division, who is also president of ADS, the UK's aerospace trade body, says the supply chain is handling the increase in production better than in previous periods.
There are some tensions in the supply chain but I wouldn't say they are critical.
"It's more about the introduction of new technologies and complexities rather than volume," Mr Bryson says.
He adds that both Airbus and Boeing have learnt from past mistakes and are being much more careful about ramping up their build rates too quickly.
An attempt to increase production in 1997 by Boeing ran into severe difficulties, with the company plunging to a net loss and its factories and supply chain struggling to cope.
Tony Wood, head of Rolls-Royce's aerospace division, says he has not yet come across any problems in the supply chain, which provide the majority of the 18,000 components required to make a jet engine.
"I'm sure there will be bumps in the road but we're pretty confident that we've done a more thorough job right across our supply chain in selecting the best partners and actually being very close with them as they prepare themselves for ramp up," Mr Wood says.
James McNerney, Boeing's chief executive, says its supply chain has been given time to prepare for the increase in build rates.
We feel very good about supply chain capability.
We have given them visibility which is really important.
Meanwhile, Fabrice Brégier, chief executive officer of Airbus passenger jet business, says the company is doing everything possible to mitigate the risks of its planned increase of the A350 to 10 aircraft per month by 2018.
"Perhaps one of the suppliers will fail so our job is to avoid it, to support them, to look for alternatives, but I don't expect big issues," he says.
Mr Brégier adds that Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: "the quality of the supply chain is the responsibility of the prime contractor.
So this is my job and this is the job of Airbus.
Hong Kong groups vow 'era of civil disobedience' as Beijing rules out open elections
China rules out full democracy for Hong Kong
Pro-democracy activists take to the streets of Hong Kong after China rejects their demands for free elections.
Underlining the potential for escalating confrontation, Hong Kong pro-democracy groups have vowed to ensure the city enters an "era of civil disobedience" in protest against proposed voting reforms imposed by the Chinese government.
Braving stop-start rain under a gleaming Hong Kong skyline, thousands of demonstrators flocked to a rally organised by pro-democracy group Occupy Central outside the offices of the Legislative Council on Sunday night, where they were urged to stage mass sit-ins to cripple the city's financial district.
It came just hours after Beijing said it would deny voters the right to publicly nominate candidates for the city's 2017 chief executive election, pushing back against months of rallies and street demonstrations that have increasingly polarised the city.
Protesters take part in the rally for the beginning of Occupy Central movement outside Central Government Offices in Hong Kong.
"This is about wanting a fair and proper election," said web-page editor Dion Tse, 24, who attended Sunday's rally with her 50-year-old mother, Wong Chi-yi.
The central government doesn't respect the voice of Hong Kong people.
We want them to hear our voice and to see the determination of Hong Kong people.
China's top legislative body, the National People's Congress, approved plans for the voting reform which will see two to three candidates allowed to stand in Hong Kong's first direct election.
But with the majority approval of a 1200-strong nomination committee needed, opposition politicians said those with dissenting political views would effectively have no chance of getting on the ballot.
Protesters take part in a rally during the Ocuppy Central with Love and Peace protest at Tamar Park outside of the Hong Kong Government Building.
Police estimated more than 2600 attended the rally at its peak.
A heavy police presence kept watch as about 100 protesters, led by student group Scholarism, converged on the Grand Hyatt late on Sunday, where Communist Party official Li Fei was scheduled to stay after arriving from Beijing.
Occupy Central co-founder Benny Tai fronted a press conference with members of other organisations including the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism, and the Federation of Students.
Mr Tai did not give an exact date for when the blockade would take place for legal reasons, but urged participants to pay attention to developments in "the next week or two," adding the city would official enter an "era of civil disobedience."
Benny Tai answers questions from the media.
"Look at the person next to you," he said at Sunday's rally, standing in front of a billboard plastered with the two Chinese characters for "disobey."
That person will be occupying Central with you!
The convenor of Scholarism, 17-year-old Joshua Wong, said earlier that preparations for high school student strikes were underway and would dovetail with the thousands of university students also expected to boycott classes.
"In addition to our academic responsibility, we also have our social responsibility," he said.
In Beijing, Li Fei, a deputy secretary-general of the NPC standing committee, told reporters that advocating for "international standards" on universal suffrage was a "waste of time" propagated by some Hong Kong politicians seeking to "confuse and mislead" society.
"A lot of time has been wasted before in the debate of impractical suggestions such as public nomination," Mr Li said, insisting that the electoral method should be made in accordance with the true situation and legal framework of each society.
To become law, the universal suffrage bill will require a super-majority of two-thirds of Hong Kong's 70-member legislature to pass, meaning the legislation could be stopped by the 27 opposition members in government.
Mr Li warned that Hong Kong could be dragged into protracted political debate if the reform proposal was vetoed.
"It would be harmful to the business environment and the city's development," he said.
Almost 800,000 people voted in an unofficial referendum organised by Occupy Central in June against China's insistence that candidates be vetted through a committee.
As many as 172,000 people marched to push for democracy on July 1, while a pro-Beijing anti-Occupy Central march on August 17 attracted about 88,000, according to estimates by the University of Hong Kong, though police and organiser estimates varied considerably.
3 Injured in Lightning Strike at New York Beach
A lightning strike at a New York City beach has injured three people.
The fire department says the men were injured at Orchard Beach on Pelham Bay in the Bronx on Sunday evening as bad storms rolled through the area.
The men are being treated at a hospital.
The extent of their injuries is unknown.
The lightning strike happened as heavy thunderstorms swept through the city.
Torrential rain, thunder and lightning interrupted Labor Day weekend celebrations, halted play at the U.S. Open tennis tournament in Queens and forced the early end to a musical festival on an East River island.
Dozens of commercial flights into the city's airports were delayed because of the severe weather.

Mount Stuart Hospital cataract ops halted amid safety fears
A consultant has been suspended and the NHS has stopped referring patients to a private hospital for cataract operations after reported problems.
Two people attended Torbay Hospital A&E department after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
Torbay Hospital, in Devon, said it contacted 19 patients treated on 26 July for an "urgent clinical review."
Mount Stuart apologised and said an inquiry was under way after the consultant's suspension.
Torbay Hospital was made aware of the problem when two patients attended its A&E department with eyesight problems after treatment at Mount Stuart.
It said none of the 19 NHS patients - all seen on the same day - have needed corrective surgery.
Torbay Hospital and the South Devon and Torbay Clinical Commissioning Group have stopped referring patients to Mount Stuart following the concerns.
David Sinclair, interim medical director at South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Torbay Hospital, said: "We identified this problem at an early stage and were able to recall all the patients affected very quickly.
Whenever we refer patients to providers, we carry out quality and safety checks and ensure that they meet current legislative and registration requirements.
Gill Gant, director for patient safety at South Devon and Torbay Clinical Commissioning Group, said: "Patient safety is always the absolute priority, so it is important that these cataract operations are paused until we have absolute assurance that the service is safe."
Ramsay Health Care UK, which runs Mount Stuart, said it offered "its sincere apologies to all patients who suffered complications."
It said: "As soon as we realised that there was a potential problem all patients were recalled by Mount Stuart Hospital and then by Torbay Hospital.
The consultant concerned has had practising privileges with Ramsay Health Care since 2005 and has been a registered doctor since 1989.
To date he has completed 4,537 cataracts across the organisation and has a history of delivering excellent clinical outcomes with a complication rate of less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added the consultant had been suspended while investigations took place.
What is 4chan?
Notorious anonymous message board first to post leaked celebrity nudes
But just what is 4chan and why was it the hacker's first port of call to post the stolen photographs?
First created in 2003, 4chan is a controversial message board that's reviled as much as it is celebrated.
The site is sub-divided into a number of sections or "boards" where anonymous users can discuss everything from video games and travel to pornography and hacking.
Unlike other online forums, users don't create consistent identities and posts aren't recorded.
On the more popular boards comments can disappear within minutes as they're pushed "off the bottom of the page" by newer posts.
These two factors have created 4chan's chaotic, anarchic and surprisingly creative atmosphere.
As an anonymous collective, its users are responsible for some of the best known internet memes online (including rickrolling and lolcats) but its lack of regulation means it's also home to a great deal of questionable and straight-forwardly criminal content.
The site's most popular board is /b/, designated for "random" discussions, and is frequently filled with NSFW or "Not Safe for Work" content.
This can vary from soft-core pornography to gore and shock images, and it was here that an anonymous hacker posted the stolen celebrity pictures over the weekend.
CytRx is pouring money into R&D of cancer-fighting drugs
CytRx Corp. is on a mission to cure cancer - or at least slow it down.
The Los Angeles biopharmaceutical company, which recently has become embroiled in a stock-promotion controversy, specializes in researching and developing drugs to treat cancers.
The most promising medication, aldoxorubicin, is a more advanced version of the widely used chemotherapy drug doxorubicin.
CytRx is conducting clinical trials of aldoxorubicin as a treatment for patients with soft-tissue sarcomas, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and recurrent glioblastoma, or brain cancer.
It's sort of like a guided missile that goes to the tumor and not to the rest of the body.- Steven Kriegsman, chief executive of CytRx, on the cancer-fighting drug aldoxorubicin
Aldoxorubicin contains a so-called linker technology that essentially acts like a Trojan horse.
It binds directly to a protein in the bloodstream that also accumulates in tumors, enabling the drug to be delivered directly to cancer cells.
The linker releases the drug only in an acidic environment, which occurs in cancer cells but not in healthy tissue.
The technology enables patients to be treated with higher and additional doses of the cancer-fighting drug.
"It's sort of like a guided missile that goes to the tumor and not to the rest of the body," said Steven Kriegsman, chief executive of CytRx.
Like many biotech companies that focus on developing drugs, CytRx isn't profitable.
The company issued stock this year, raising about $86 million for operations and research.
CytRx is in the middle of recruiting 400 patients worldwide for its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of a second-line treatment for soft-tissue sarcoma.
Soft-tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that can develop in the soft tissues of the body, such as blood vessels, muscles and fat.
A second-line treatment is used when the first-line treatment against the cancer fails.
If the clinical trial is successful, CytRx plans to apply for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as 2016, Kriegsman said.
The drug could then gain approval by 2017.
Analysts said CytRx released data in December from an earlier clinical trial that indicated aldoxorubicin was a promising treatment for soft-tissue sarcoma.
"For a long time, there was a question of 'We haven't seen clinical data, how different is it from the underlying drug?'" said Andrew Fein, an analyst at H. C. Wainwright & Co.
The release of the results substantiated in a lot of people's mind that it is different.
But Fein said it is hard to predict the outcome and timeline of the current clinical trial because it significantly differs from the previous one that produced good results.
"A lot of things need to go right," he said.
Fein compared developing drugs to the mining industry.
"You invest a lot of money looking for that one spot on the ground that bears gold, and up until you find that spot you continue to pour money in," he said.
Up until you successfully commercialize the drug, it's a continual R&D spend.
CytRx has been hit with multiple shareholder lawsuits contending that the company unfairly touted its performance.
The lawsuits accused the company of hiring the investor relations firm DreamTeam Group, which then allegedly hired writers to promote CytRx and another biotech firm through articles on websites such as Forbes, Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
The articles didn't disclose that they were commissioned by the companies, the lawsuits alleged.
In response to the news, Seeking Alpha said it had removed articles "that were in violation of our policies."
Several stories about the company also disappeared from other websites.
Kriegsman declined to comment on the allegations.
The company has hired outside counsel to defend against the lawsuits.
"It's not something I have time or energy to focus on," he said.
Kriegsman said a real challenge facing CytRx is hiring talented employees, who tend to flock to the biotech centers of San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"It's sort of a wasteland in many ways here" for the pharmaceutical industry, he said.
Analyst views
Shares of CytRx hit $8.08 on Jan. 10, then plunged to below $3 in April after the stock promotion allegations surfaced.
Analyst said the lawsuits and negative publicity have pushed the stock price down further than the fundamentals of the company would warrant.
"It's unfortunate," Fein said, "but I am not sure there is an easy way to get around that as long as the perception is there."
The cameraman of the TV series ”Cops” killed during filming
The cameraman of the TV series ”Cops”, which is based on true events and which is aired also in Finland, died on Tuesday evening when he was shot during an armed conflict.
The cameraman was taping a shootout between an Omaha police patrol and a man suspected of an armed robbery of a fast food restaurant, when he was hit by the bullets.
He quickly died from the injuries.
According to the TMZ site, the police reported that in addition to the cameraman, also the armed robbery suspect died in the shootout.
The TV series ”Cops”, which is among the first reality TV programs, has been broadcast in the US since 1989.
In Finland the series has aired on MTV’s channels since the 1990s.
The question regarding an external killer is going to stand out as the crucial element in the Ulvila killing process, which started today in the Court of Appeal.
Anneli Auer is accused of murdering her husband Jukka S. Lahti in 2006.
The Court of Appeal in Vaasa will hear the case now for the second time, as the Supreme Court returned it to the District Court along with the new evidence.
The intention of the Court of Appeal is to give the sentence before the current year ends.
The Court of Appeal of Vaasa acquitted Ms Auer in 2011.
At that time, the court considered the possibility of an external killer likely enough.
In his opening speech, the District Prosecutor Kalle Kulmala relayed the prosecutor’s view about the murder night, and about those factors which exclude the possibility of an external killer.
We believe that the crucial question is whether an external person has entered the house and killed Jukka Lahti in a way and in the time Anneli Auer has told.
It is about the credibility of Anneli Auer’s account,” Kulmala says.
According to the prosecutor, the homicide started from a domestic dispute, during which Ms Auer had announced that she will leave home and file for divorce.
At some point they moved to the kitchen, where Mr Lahti held Ms Auer and tried to stop her from leaving.
One of them took the kitchen knife,” Kulmala described the murder night events on Monday.
According to the prosecutor, several factors prove that there was no external person present.
For example, the emergency call recording doesn’t contain any sounds of an external person.
Auer’s eldest child – daughter – told in an interrogation that she saw the killer, when the man exited the fireplace room door.
The acquittal ruled by the Court of Appeal of Vaasa in 2011 was partially based on the daughter’s account.
According to the prosecutor the daughter’s observation can’t be true.
”The daughter didn’t see any external killer in her parents’ bedroom, even if she went to see there twice,” Kulmala said.
Prosecutor’s new witness is connected exactly to the possibility of an external killer.
Jukka S. Lahti’s sister has told about what happened in the hospital after the murder night.
According to the woman, the only thing the daughter told in the hospital was that she only saw Lahti’s body when she went to the killing scene in the fireplace room.
Auer’s defence is going to present the court with investigation lines the weight of which the police hasn’t, according to the defence, investigated sufficiently.
When the Court of Appeal of Vaasa acquitted Ms Auer three years ago, the court deemed the male DNA found on a billet as one reference of an external person.
Later the sample turned out to be the DNA of a researcher working in the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation laboratory.
At that time, a mass DNA sample was taken from 700 persons.
At the same time, a significant amount of serious suspects and alternative investigation lines were excluded,” defence attorney Juha Manner said.
One of the defence’s new witnesses tells about a possible external killer.
A woman from Ulvila told the police about a man from Pori, who, according to the woman’s account, had confessed the killing.
The police interrogated the man in the summer.
The prosecutor deliberated that the man from Pori didn’t have anything to do with the homicide.
The prosecutor filed a request for examination for the woman, as the prosecutor suspects the woman has lied in her account.
The other new witness of the defence is the nurse who was on duty on the murder night at Satakunta Central Hospital.
The District Court of Satakunta gave Auer a life sentence for murder last December.
According to the District Court sentence, the elements against the possibility of an external killer include for example the accounts of Auer’s children, the missing sounds referring to an external killer on the emergency call recording, as well as the time required by the course of the events.
The sentence was given with votes 2-1.
The judge representing the minority in the voting wrote that in a crime case a conflicting evidence must be considered in favour of the dependant.
For that reason, the daughter’s account must be interpreted so, that notwithstanding the discrepancies in the account she had seen an external killer exiting the fireplace room door.
Auer’s two eldest children have been summoned before the court.
The daughter was heard personally for the first time last year at the District Court of Satakunta.
When heard before the court, she couldn’t recall the murder night events any more.
Auer’s second child named the mother as the killer in a video interrogation in 2011.
The son told he had heard what happened on the murder night through a closed door.
He also told that Auer had been planning the murder for six months.
As a plaintiff the son has no obligation to state anything before the Court of Appeal.
The hearing of the Court of Appeal will continue today with the hearing of Anneli Auer.
If necessary, the hearing of Anneli Auer will continue also tomorrow.
Anneli Auer is currently serving a sentence of over seven years for sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin be allowed to attend the G20?
He'S public enemy number one at the moment thanks to his actions in Ukraine.
And with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to attend the G20 summit held in Brisbane in November, whether or not he should be allowed into the country is a matter of hot debate.
Over the weekend, punk-rock activists Pussy Riot called for Australia to ban Putin from attending the global summit, which includes more than 4000 delegates from the world's most powerful nations.
"We think that this person has no place at the G20," Maria Alyokhina told a packed Sydney Opera House at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Now, with Kiev warning it's on the brink of "full-scale war" and Putin referring to parts of Ukraine as "Novorossiya" or "new Russia," should we really be welcoming here?
Tony Abbott said he is "weighing" the decision.
The Lowy Institute's G20 studies centre director Mike Callaghan said although the meeting is held in Australia, it's not really up to us who comes.
"Australia can say who comes into the country but it's an international meeting," he said.
Much like New York hosts meetings for the UN or Washington hosts meetings for the IMF, Mr Callaghan said "it's not up to the hosts to say 'you can't come.'"
Last week, Tony Abbott said he is "weighing" the decision after Russia's "reprehensible" actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important question.
Because he would be coming for a critical international gathering, it's not a decision which Australia really has a right to make unilaterally.
"Nevertheless, it is an important question and it's one that I'll be weighing and I suspect a number of other countries will be weighing in the weeks ahead," he said.
People attend an anti-war meeting Mariupol, eastern Ukraine.
The event takes place over two days and includes a mix of the world's biggest and emerging economies which accounts for about two thirds of the global population, 85 per cent of its GDP and 75 per cent of global trade.
Members range from Canada to China, France, Japan, Russia, the US and European Union with special invites for a selection of non-G20 members such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
Mr Callaghan said Australia was in the unenviable position of having to balance diverse interests under intense public pressure.
He said the best way for the Prime Minister to handle it was to use the opportunity to grill Russia on what they have been up to.
"The Prime Minister should say "We will be using this opportunity to have a very frank discussion and I will be demanding for President Putin to account for his actions."
To put the onus on if he comes, he will have to face scrutiny," he said.
Quite clearly we're seeing a rise in geopolitical tensions.
I think the world would be expecting them to talk about these things.
Pro-Russian rebels prepare arms for the assault on the positions of Ukrainian army in Donetsk airport, eastern Ukraine.
It's still unclear whether Putin will attend the event and Mr Callaghan said we may not now until days before.
This is probably the last thing on his mind.
I don't think he's going to say "I have to change my attitude on Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November.""
Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said while he had the "gravest reservations about that man, Mr Putin, coming to Australia," he understands the fact it's an international conference.
It is probably time for the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister to be talking to other nations, other members of the G20, about whether it is appropriate for Mr Putin to come to Australia.
It is an international conference, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
But following the tragic events of MH17, the complete lack of remorse or responsibility, the lack of full co-operation in terms of MH17, and now, scenes of thousands of Russian soldiers flooding across the Ukrainian border, I think most Australians have grave reservations about welcoming Mr Putin to Australia.
German business attacks "complacent" Berlin
Germany has become "overconfident" and "complacent," with the government pursuing policies that put the country's hard-won competitiveness at risk, some of Germany's top business leaders warn.
Their criticisms of chancellor Angela Merkel's government come as Europe's largest economy is showing signs of slowing, raising concerns about its ability to continue driving growth in the stagnant eurozone.
Their remarks follow the introduction of policies fiercely opposed by corporate Germany such as the introduction of a minimum wage and a reduction in the retirement age to 63 for certain long-serving workers.
"I think the biggest threat right now is really a kind of overconfidence in Germany, and with that comes a little bit of complacency," said Kurt Bock, the chief executive of BASF, the world's biggest chemical maker by sales.
IN EU Economy
He said: "In general the feeling is that we're doing well, we have money to spend, we have relatively low unemployment, so what's the problem?"
I think that is a big risk.
You can see it in German government policies that we are not really growth-orientated or business-friendly, but rather much more orientated towards the distribution of wealth and serving the expectations of certain stakeholders.
Markus Kerber, managing director of the BDI, the German industry association, said: "Germany is now in a very good position.
But in the next 10 years every economy in the developed world must change. ...[In Germany] the reform agenda is not making the progress that it did in previous years.
The DIHK, the national chamber of commerce, has also railed against the recent policy moves.
Germany continues to enjoy low levels of unemployment and an almost-balanced budget; even consumption, once languid, is growing.
However, poor second-quarter GDP figures have underscored the vulnerability of the export-driven German economy to external shocks, such as from Russia and Ukraine.
GDP dropped 0.2 per cent in the three months to June, compared to the previous quarter.
Germany's lacklustre performance threatens to make the European Central Bank's battle against low inflation even harder and could make quantitative easing more likely.
Mr Kerber urged the government to "switch back from public consumption to public investment," for example by focusing future spending increases more on infrastructure and less on pensions.
He argued that the Merkel government was reaping the rewards of the tough policies enacted in the early 2000s by her Social Democrat predecessor, Gerhard Schröder.
Stefan Heidbreder, managing director at the Stiftung Familienunternehmen, a foundation for family-owned businesses, said: "Germany is still in a good position, compared to other countries.
That is thanks to its companies and less to do with the policies of the government . . .
The experience of our neighbour, France, shows that doling out lots of money for social benefits and intervening to limit freedom to conduct business are the wrong course.
A leading German investment banker was more blunt, describing recent government policies as a "disaster."
Germany risks forgetting everything it has worked hard to achieve in order to just please the electorate.
That's my key concern right now," the banker said.
Mr Bock said the new government coalition's energy reforms had failed to tackle the underlying weaknesses in policy which has left industry facing uncompetitive costs.
Ashton Kutcher reportedly in brawl at music festival after security blocked him from greeting fan
Actor Ashton Kutcher attends the Stagecoach country music festival in Indio, California, where he reportedly got into an altercation with a pushy security guard.
Ashton Kutcher reportedly got into a violent altercation with security at a country music festival.
Kutcher was approached by a fan backstage at Stagecoach country music festival in California when things got out of control, TMZ reports.
Kutcher was hanging out in the VIP area when a young woman approached to say hi and shake his hand.
When the Two and a Half Men star went to greet her, overzealous security rushed between them, causing a scuffle.
The actor and the guard got into it, and Kutcher's friends had to restrain him, TMZ reports.
Kutcher is dating his former That 70s Show co-star Mila Kunis after splitting from ex-wife Demi Moore.
The scuffle comes after news that Angus T Jones has basically been dropped as a regular cast member from the hit show, after releasing a video calling the show "filth" and urging fans not to watch.

Vacationer killed by Baltic Sea bacteria
Six people were infected with a bacteria from the Caribbean which has made itself at home in the popular German vacation destination.
One of them is now in a coma.
The bacterium, Vibrio vulnificus, is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and other regions of the world, though most-concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico.
It spreads best in brackish waters with temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius.
"This could be found anywhere as long as the conditions are right," Dr. Heiko Will, the first director of State Office of Health and Welfare (LAGuS) of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, told The Local.
It is just as prevalent in Denmark, Poland, and all along the German coast.
The victim had been holidaying on the island of Usedom at the end of July, according (LAGuS).
He passed away at the beginning of August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks and there is a possibility he will lose a leg.
He went swimming near Ahrenshoop with a small open wound on his leg.
He went to the hospital after noticing on the drive home that his leg had turned blue.
Doctors diagnosed blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnificus.
"My husband would not have been in the Baltic Sea under any circumstances had he known about the danger," his wife, Sonja Bruehl, told the Ostsee Zeitung.
His serious illness and the havoc the sepsis has brought to him and his family could have been avoided with better information, such as a notice from the resort.
LAGuS told dpa news agency that doctors were told to look out for infections at the beginning of the summer, though no public notice was given.
Cooler temperatures have made the already low risk of contracting the bacteria even more nominal.
"The results we have from [Monday's] tests showed a stark decrease in the presence of V. vulnificus," Dr. Will said.
The cooler temperatures have done their job.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative to the bacteria that causes cholera, is especially harmful to those with chronic liver disease and compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV or diabetes and the elderly.
Men are also at a higher risk as oestrogen has shown to have a protective effect against the pathogen.
If it takes hold, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
Wounds infected by the bacteria have a mortality rate of approximately 25 percent.
The bacteria can also infect people through the ingestion of seafood containing V. vulnificus, though Dr. Will said that is not the case here.
It is mostly in the southern hemisphere where the seafood is also infected.
The last recorded deaths in Germany from V. vulnificus poisoning were in 2010, when the bacteria claimed two victims.
Vieno Kekkonen: mastectomy due to cancer suspects
Revelation Singer Vieno Kekkonen, who will turn 80, is doing gigs and working out often, but she also has had to fear for her health.
It surely is unbelievable that radiant Vieno Kekkonen is already turning 80.
She’s astounded herself, too, about how the years suddenly are so many.
I haven’t really realized that I’m this old.
80 sounds really a lot, Vieno Kekkonen says, letting out a laughter.
The birthday will be spent with family.
At the end of August, a birthday celebration was organized for her by a folk music and pensioner association in Karttula, where she lived as a child.
We were on the stage of Kekkola, the same place where my grandfather was born.
I was completely bemused by the celebration, the birthday lady says, referring to the event where the stage, fit for three hundred, was cramped with people who wanted to congratulate her.
A couple of days later, in Muhos, there was an event to greet Armi Kuusela, the life of whom Vieno Kekkonen remembers having followed when she was young.
And now we’re both this old!
Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
During her long career there only are few sides of Vieno Kekkonen that haven’t been seen in the public.
One thing she has never told publicly: in 2006 she had an unilateral mastectomy.
There was an ambiguous finding on my breast in such spot that it was decided to remove the breast completely.
Eventually it wasn’t cancer, which of course made me happy.
During the same operation a new breast was made, so it was a rather large operation.
Vieno Kekkonen hasn’t thought that losing her breast was in a way unnecessary, because the awareness of an ambiguous finding would have been a heavy burden to bear, and such thing can’t be not taken care of.
I was just so relieved when it wasn’t anything serious, Vieno Kekkonen says, and notes that for younger women losing a breast is surely more difficult.

Farmers being made the party responsible for the sea condition
The level of the discussion about the bad conditions of the Baltic Sea in connection with the Finnish agriculture is depressing.
The voice of the experts has been drowned in politically motivated opinions.
During the summer, especially Helsingin Sanomat and Yle have insisted on agriculture’s responsibility for the nutrient emissions in the Baltic Sea.
In the same breath, quick actions for getting the emissions under control have been demanded.
Compared to few environment researchers, and journalists who have studied the matter with their help, an average farmer seems a supreme nutrient expert.
Farmers know that the nutrient wash can’t originate from farming, if the same amount of nutrients has been sowed into the field as it is being harvested from it.
In Finland, nearly all farms have committed themselves to the environment program.
The program strictly restricts the use of the fertilizers, and it requires accurate tracking and reporting of the nutrient balance.
The authorities monitor that the conditions are being followed.
The nutrients which are accumulated in the field have washed up into the waterways also after the fertilizer restrictions, but also in this matter a clear diminishing in the emissions has been evident for years.
The farmers have the willingness and the capacity to work further in order to reduce the nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should understand that the zero level is impossible to reach.
”If the goal is to have such an amount of agriculture production that it approximately meets the consumption, you just have to accept that it’s like this,” says Jyrki Aakkula, the director of environment research in MTT Agrifood Research Finland (MT, August 29th).
The past summer brought large blue-green algae accumulations to the Gulf of Finland.
The researchers agreed quite unanimously that the algae drew its growth force from the sea’s own phosphorus reserves.
The phosphorus accumulated in the bottom of the sea comes partially from the coast countries’ agriculture during the past decades, but can’t explain the accumulation alone.
The cleaning of the waste waters of the growing cities on the Baltic Sea coasts was neglected until the end of 20th century.
The problem concerned also the waste waters of the Greater Helsinki and they weren’t considered a problem except in terms of contamination of city’s own shores.
The contamination of the shores was prevented by building, still as late as in the 1980s, a waste water tube which reached the open sea.
The quality of the water conducted to it has of course improved over the years.
The nutrients that have ended up in the sea in the past won’t disappear, even if the agriculture would be terminated completely in Finland.
And yet, every summer, the blue-green algae discussion, and the raised accusations always target today’s agriculture.
The public debate stigmatises the farmer as the responsible for the Baltic Sea’s condition.
The accusation is excessive, but it becomes even more troublesome when it’s being used as a mean to fulfil political ambitions.
The Greens are driving great changes in the environment norms for the agriculture, lead by the Minister of the Environment Ville Niinistö.
Mr. Niinistö has used this summer’s algae debate as a stepping stone.
Mr. Niinistö has accused, using harsh words, the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK) for being antiquated, and has considered it the most difficult obstacle for the water protection.
Also the political rhetoric should have a limit.
Most of the special projects related to the water protection are explicitly based on the cooperation between MTK, farmers, and environment administration.
Mr. Niinistö’s offensive style serves more the attempts to lure the votes of the urban green voters, than the water protection.
Well, that’s probably its purpose.
By using hard talk the Greens are preparing themselves for leaving the government.
In case of policy changes, the MTK’s task is to take care of the subsistence of their members.
It is difficult to sell expensive changes to farmers, if you can’t get a reimburse for the expenses.
The only funds Ville Niinistö has talked about, are the cuts from other agriculture funds.
Mining tax repeal won't pass: Palmer
The Abbott government's latest attempt to scrap the mining tax appears doomed with Clive Palmer declaring his senators will vote it down without changes.
Labor also fears the government has included a measure in a new repeal bill that could limit increases to compulsory superannuation contributions by employers out to 2034.
The government amid confusion and heated Labor indignation used its numbers in parliament's lower house on Monday to rush through its repeal legislation.
It laid aside the original repeal bill, which the Senate previously had amended heavily, and replaced it with new legislation initially described as relating to tax, superannuation, social security and family assistance.
Essentially, it was a bill that repealed the "failed" mining tax, plus a range of associated measures including the low-income superannuation contribution (saving $3.6 billion), the income support bonus ($1.3 billion) and the schoolkids bonus ($4.7 billion).
Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer was dismissive of the government move.
"Ill-conceived mining tax repeal bill wont pass Senate without low income super contribution, income support bonus & the schoolkids bonus," he tweeted.
The government needs the support of PUP and other crossbenchers to have its bill clear the Senate against opposition from Labor and the Greens.
Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen accused the government of trying to remove parliament's ability to decide the rate of the superannuation compulsory guarantee, giving all the authority to the treasurer to determine any changes.
"This is outrageous," he told reporters in Canberra.
It would allow the government to delay further increases, pushing out Labor's desired target of 12 per cent rate to as far as 2034.
"That is completely unacceptable and the Labor party of course will oppose that all the way," Mr Bowen said.
The rate is now 9.5 per cent, but the government wants the treasurer to have the power to pause further increases.
Man's body found on Brighton beach
The dead man, who has not been identified, was retrieved before high tide at 2pm by officers from Sussex Police who cordoned off the area, which was close to the start of the Volk's Electric Railway tourist attraction.
Police officers and the coroner's officers are working to establish the circumstances of how the body came to be there.
The man has not been identified yet.
Detectives are to check missing persons reports to find out whether any are connected to the dead man.
Officers were unable to confirm if the death was suspicious.
Mexico Police: Accidental Blast Kills 1 on Border
Police in Piedras Negras say that an apparently accidental explosion in a customs building on Mexico's border with the U.S. has killed one woman and injured five other people.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas is the director of operations for the local municipal police in the city on the border with Texas.
He tells The Associated Press that the woman who died in the Sunday blast suffered a fractured skull and the other five people had burns.
Lopez Arenas says the blast occurred in the morning in a dormitory for customs agents.
The cause of the explosion is under investigation, but authorities believe it was caused by an accumulation of gas.
The explosion did not affect border operations.
Three Atlantic City Casinos to Close in September
Three Atlantic City Casinos Will Go Dark This Month
A man gambles at the Showboat casino, which is scheduled to close, in Atlantic City, N.J., on July 29, 2014
September is expected to be hard month for Atlantic City, as three of its casinos deal out their last hands
Three casinos will close this month in Atlantic City, N.J., signaling that this metropolis of neon lights and blinking slot machines can no longer bet on gaming revenues.
More than 5,000 workers will be out of a job when the casinos Showboat and Revel close this weekend, the Associated Press reports.
Even more will lose their livelihoods when the Trump Plaza cuts its lights.
The expected closure of the three casinos, one of which is just two years old, is the latest slap to this city, coming just eight months after the Atlantic Club ran out of luck.
By the end of September, more than 25% of the city's casino workforce, or 8,000 people, will be out of work, the New York Times reports.
When New Jersey legalized gaming in 1976, casinos were marketed as a sure bet for economically battered Atlantic City, the AP reports.
But the regional gaming market has since become flush with competitors, with casinos in New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania claiming chunks of the once prodigious profits flowing into Atlantic City.
Even Massachusetts, a once gaming-averse state, is eyeing a share of the rewards, as it flirts with inviting three casinos to the state.
TVO: Areva’s new schedule hard to accept
Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) says it finds it difficult to accept the new estimation from the facility supplier Areva, according to which the third reactor of Olkiluoto will only be available for commercial use in 2018.
Jouni Silvennoinen, the director of the power station project, says that the reason for this is for example the fact that the construction is largely complete, and the amount of uncompleted work is known.
TVO continues assessing the information received from Areva.
Mr. Silvennoinen says in his statement that TVO welcomes all initiatives which allow the project to be accelerated.
Areva provided TVO with the updated schedule concerning the Olkiluoto 3 today, and according to the schedule the construction of the third reactor will be completed in mid-2016, and the commercial activity could start in 2018.
According to Areva’s statement, the project’s latest delays are due mainly to the acceptance of the automation system of the reactor. The acceptance was obtained in April.
It was preceded by negotiations with TVO which took four years.
Originally, Olkiluoto 3 was supposed to be completed in 2009, but the schedule has been postponed time after another.
TVO and Areva have been quarrelling about who is responsible for the delay for years.
The dispute has been taken to the Court of Arbitration, and Areva has demanded no less than 2.7 billion euros in damages from TVO.
TVO considers Areva’s claims unfounded, and is demanding approximately 1.8 billion euros from the company.
Energy and Water Communities Must Cooperate to Meet Global Challenges
Global leaders gathered in Stockholm today for the 24th annual World Water Week, urging the energy and water communities to work together to face some of the main challenges of our time, providing clean drinking water and energy for a growing world population.
The theme of 2014 World Water Week is "Energy and Water."
Water and energy are interdependent in more ways than not.
We need energy for pumping, storing, transporting and treating water, we need water for producing almost all sorts of energy.
An increase or decrease in one will immediately affect the other.
The two resources are also inseparable from sustainable development and must be tirelessly promoted in global decision-making.
Addressing the opening session of the Week, Mr. Torgny Holmgren, Executive Director of World Water Week organiser Stockholm International Water Institute, said: "The challenges are immense."
With the global demand for water projected to grow by 55 per cent between 2000 and 2050 and electricity demand expected to increase by 50 per cent in the next two decades, there is an urgent need for a closer relationship between the energy and water communities if we are to provide solutions for all peoples to prosper.
Professor John Briscoe, this year's Stockholm Water Prize laureate, spoke about water as a platform for growth, both of other sectors and society as a whole, and said that "developing countries face big challenges.
They have yet to mobilise those resources.
He added that there is "no eternal solution [to the water crisis], neither here nor there."
Instead, there is a cycle of challenges and responses.
In over 100 seminars, workshops and events spread throughout the week, delegates will discuss ongoing and future work and collaboration between the energy and water communities.
Professor John Briscoe, a native of South Africa, will receive the Stockholm Water Prize from H.M. King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, during a ceremony in Stockholm City Hall on Thursday 4 September.
Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a policy institute that generates knowledge and informs decision-makers towards water wise policy and sustainable development.
Shipping Dead Foreigners' Bodies in Miami: The Cost of Flying Corpses
In October 2012 a raft carrying twenty-three Cuban refugees on its way to Miami capsized and a reported fourteen people drowned.
It had happened to hundreds more before them, and they surely will not be the last.
Every year more than 1,000 Central Americans die trying to illegally cross the U.S. border.
The transnational city is a place to die for.
Ironically, however, once established in the transnational city, few envision staying there until their last breath.
For many, it is a temporary venue, whether as a place of exile, a springboard for upward mobility, or a playground until new opportunities beckon.
Few imagine dying there and, as the moment draws near, many make plans to go home.
In the transnational city, which is home to a disproportionate number of the foreign-born and expatriates, death and repatriation are a steady business.
The bodies of an estimated 20 percent of South Florida's deceased are shipped out, more than from any other region in the USA.
Most of the HRs (industry shorthand for human remains) going abroad depart from Miami International Airport.
According to the CEO of Pierson, a leader in this business since 1964, around 80 percent of business is international, with the company shipping to a range of foreign destinations across Central and South America and a number of European countries as well.

As more and more migrants move to transnational cities, they too die there.
And even in death, there are still costs to return home.
Miami is the hub for American Airlines in Latin America, and the figures in the table are the airline's rates for repatriating human remains in 2013.
The cost of shipping a body is not cheap, ranging from about $500 to well into the thousands of dollars.
The requirements for the shipment and delivery of HRs also vary for religious, cultural, and public health reasons.
Given the expense and the lack of government assistance to repatriate the dead, who are often young and uninsured, immigrant communities in transnational cities sometimes organize burial societies to help offset costs.
The origins of some credit unions and informal health insurance programs can be traced back to such societies established by Italians, Jews, and Greeks in New York, who were among the first transnationals in America.
Newer generations of Mexicans, Chinese, Filipinos, and Bangladeshis are now doing the same in several transnational cities.

Clearly, dying abroad does not come without complications because few expats intend or plan to make the transnational city their eternal home.
For instance, in Dubai, in the absence of a will for a deceased expat, Sharia law is applied and supersedes the laws governing inheritance in the deceased's home country.
All assets, if there are any, are frozen and subsequently dispersed at the discretion of the Sharia court.
The extent of the human remains repatriation network (c.
2013) of the Dublin-based airline Aer Lingus reflects the transnational character of the city and of the Irish.
At one time discontinued, the human remains service was reinstated by the airline in 2004 after condemnation by emigrant groups.
The thought of dying rarely enters the minds of those passing through or living in a transnational city.
On the contrary, becoming an expat or immigrant in the transnational city is an open declaration about how one views life, not death.
Yet it is in the approach of death that the transnational city offers the foreign-born its most stark and ultimate choices of belonging--between the local and global, between cosmos and earth, and between the transient and eternal.
Centre Party and Left Alliance submit an interpellation concerning inequality
The opposition parties Centre Party and Left Alliance are going to submit to the government an interpellation concerning the subsistence of the persons with low income, and the increasing inequality.
The parties want to instigate debate about people’s subsistence problems, which are culminating due to the weak economy development and the worsening unemployment.
The parties point out in their statement that the growing inequality can also be seen between different parts of the country, as well as within big cities.
According to the parties, the cuts and tax increases in the government’s budget for the next year are targeting the people with low income, such as the students, the unemployed, and the pensioners, people with families, and ordinary workers, while for example food, medicines, and living continue becoming more expensive.
The reality is that there are nearly half million people unemployed now, the parties say in their statement.
Also the subsistence problems of the people in employment have worsened.
The parliamentary groups of the Centre Party and the Left Alliance will discuss the matter on Thursday.
The third opposition party, The Finns Party, has declared previously that it will submit an interpellation concerning the resources of the police and the internal security.
The autumn session of the parliament starts tomorrow (Tuesday).
NYC's Huge West Indian Day Parade Set to Step Off
Caribbean culture is set to get its annual spotlight in New York City, where the West Indian Day Parade is one of the year's biggest outdoor events - and political see-and-be-seen spots.
The annual parade is set for Monday in Brooklyn.
It echoes traditional pre-Lenten Carnival festivities and features dancers wearing elaborate, often feathered costumes.
Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams is this year's grand marshal, but expect plenty of other political faces in the lineup.
The parade is a prime place for officeholders and candidates to greet the public the week before Primary Day.
For all the festivity, the parade weekend also has been scarred in recent years by violence nearby.
Police have said they're taking steps to keep the event safe, such as keeping tabs on any gang activity.
Is it worth asking a rhetorical question?
Everyone knows about rhetorical questions, don't they?
Don't answer that.
This figure of speech - a question that does not anticipate an answer but implies one - peppers everything from the highest-flown oratory to everyday conversational exchanges.
The opening of Cicero's famous denunciation of Catiline is a run of rhetorical questions, starting: "When, O Catiline, do you mean to cease abusing our patience?"
So are my arguments with my wife: "What's wrong with reheating five-day-old chicken for the kids?"
Why are you so uptight?
The fancy term for rhetorical questions is erotema.
Their virtue is in taking what might be an open question and forcing the audience to accept it as a given.
They imply, sneakily, that nobody sane could possibly disagree.
The author of a 19th-century composition manual, David Williams, described them as "a mode of address admirably calculated to produce a powerful impression of the truth of a subject, as it challenges the impossibility of contradiction."
The Art of Persuasion
You can string them together for more ambitious effects.
A succession of rhetorical questions designed to express grief or indignation is called epiplexis.
You find these in Job's appeals to the Almighty: "Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress . . .?
Hast thou eyes of flesh?
Or seest thou as man seeth?
Also in comments from my wife: "Why did you give the children food poisoning?
Are you mad?
Can't you do anything right?
Or there's hypophora, which is where you ask a question and immediately answer it.
A fine example is furnished by Isaac Hayes: "Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks?
Shaft!
Ya damn right!
Who's the man that would risk his neck for his brother man?
Also, my wife: "What's the one thing they've eaten that could have made them sick?"
That chicken.
Which idiot fed it to them?
You.
Oddly, however, despite rhetoric being the art of persuasion, a rhetorical question is often not all that persuasive.
If you are in the business of talking someone round, rather than preaching to the converted or railing against the obdurate, you should use rhetorical questions with caution.
They are better at consolidating assent than winning it.
If your audience agrees with the proposition - "Isn't it nice it's so sunny?" - a rhetorical question signals the speaker's confidence in that and so, as it were, binds speaker and audience closer.
But it will only do that if you are sure there is no room for dissent.
By presuming on agreement rather than asking for it, you can sound, well, presumptuous.
In other circumstances, rhetorical questions indicate the weak point in an argument.
Where they appear in newspaper headlines they are all too often obvious as the strongest available statement of a very weak case: "Did aliens build the pyramids?"
In both instances they are vulnerable to the straightforward takedown of giving an answer, and not the one implied.
"Are you thinking what we're thinking?" was the high-risk general election campaign slogan of the British Conservative party in 2005.
It lost.
To some, spotting this sort of thing has become a hobby, and QTWAIN (Questions To Which Answer Is No) - popularised by British journalist John Rentoul - has taken hold.
Some years ago a friend ran a competition to find the best examples.
The clear winner was "Do You Wanna Be In My Gang?," as sung by pop star Gary Glitter - before he was revealed to be a child-sex offender.
The writer is the author of "You Talkin" to Me?"
Researcher: the time of a federation compromise may be over
In the beginning of the conflict the thought was that a federation could be a some kind of compromise for the conflict, Saari says.
Earlier, in an interview with a Russian channel, Russian President Vladimir Putin said reaching the peace in the eastern Ukraine requires talks on the statehood of the area.
In practice, this would mean some sort of autonomy in eastern Ukraine.
According to Putin, it would protect the legal rights of the people living in the eastern part.
Saari says Ukraine’s change into a federation is in a certain way a priority among the objectives Russia is aiming at.
Ukraine suspects, probably for a reason, that Russia would attempt to affect Ukraine’s internal affairs, he says.
If the federation solution can’t be reached, an alternative, from Russia’s point of view, could be some kind of frozen conflict, where Russia virtually would have the control over Luhansk and Donetsk, Saari estimates.
The West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending both arms and soldiers to the east.
Russia has denied the claims, even if the pro-Russian insurgents have themselves told that ”volunteering Russian soldiers on a leave” have been fighting among them.
FIIA’s director: An influential office for Katainen has been planned
Tiilikainen reminds that the job is a new one, and still in the making.
She says the idea is that Katainen would in some manner coordinate, or even lead commission’s work in the matters concerning competitiveness and employment.
One of the focus areas in the commission’s new season is of course the competitiveness and the employment of the Union.
In that way we are in the heart of the power of the commission, Tiilikainen says.
Tiilikainen believes that Katainen’s background, economic skills, and role during the economic crisis give him the opportunity to reach a good position within the commission.
According to the plans, the office would be without Portfolio, i.e. Katainen wouldn’t be managing any main department of his own.
Katainen would become a team leader instead in the field of EU’s competitiveness and employment, and in that case, besides the Portfolio of the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, he also might have other related Portfolios to coordinate.
In practice, leading a team might mean for example planning and instructing.
Soldiers’ Mothers: even 15,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to Committee of Soldiers’ Mothers of Russia, even 15,000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine in the past two months, and currently the country is hosting over 7,000 Russian soldiers.
Human rights organisations say at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
The committee says the hospital of the city of Rostov near Ukraine’s border is crowded with persons wounded in the war in Ukraine.
The Soldiers’ Mothers collect their information from the soldiers’ relatives.
The military alliance Nato has estimated there are over 1,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
BB Andte on his alcohol consumption: ”After a little shot the talking starts”
Big Brother On Monday evening, Jussi and Andte ended up contemplating the life in the BB house.
Jussi, who’s on the basement side, was pedalling the exercise bicycle on Monday evening, chatting with Andte, who is one of the inhabitants of the Mansion.
The duo was wondering what does the audience think about their actions, how they see it.
You don’t know before you’ve seen, Andte said.
Jussi thinks that the most of the time in the BB house goes to waiting and killing time.
The possible parties or tasks are only a fraction of the life in the BB house.
You’re mostly waiting and wondering and chatting and just living.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
The Mansion people spent the Wednesday evening within a liquid framework, and the alcohol made especially Andte talkative.
In fact, Jussi enquired him if the parties had made the man’s life in the house more meaningful now when he, being a little tipsy, has been able to chit-chat with other contestants.
When you take a little shot the talking starts, Andte admitted.
Watch Andte’s interview on ISTV video!
