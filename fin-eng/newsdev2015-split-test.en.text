Anna Abreu reveals her ideal body in Me Naiset
Anna Abreu tells in Me Naiset magazine she decided to lose weight two years ago when she took a pause from touring.
At that time, Anna was tired of touring, and thought that along with the weight loss she would gain more energy.

A couple of years ago Anna was dreaming about the body type of Victoria’s Secret models.
My ideal body looked like that of a Victoria’s Secret model.
I wanted to look good, and I thought that I wanted to lose weight, Anna tells the magazine.
Anna displays her trained body at gigs and in the music videos, but says that she doesn’t work out like crazy, even if she’s been depicted as someone doing so.

Anna, who has a very fit body, goes to the gym and practices boxing.
Visible muscles aren’t important, but the fact that I’ll manage to lift a certain amount of weight at the gym, Anna says.
Every once in a while the pop star gives herself a permission to indulge with food.
If I indulge with food, I really do so.
Sometimes I overeat in an unhealthy way, without thinking whether I just gained weight.
Instead I’m wondering what my body is thinking.
I feel disgusted if I hurt my body somehow.

Anna tells she’s comfortable in her body.
Corporate pruning pleases shareholders but fails to stimulate growth
Are the chief executives of Australia's listed companies turning into a bunch of crowd-pleasers, bowing to shareholders' desire for higher dividends and to engage in share buybacks?
Could it be that the balance of power has shifted from the boardrooms to the shareholders they serve?
The evidence is clear from last week's close of the 2014 reporting season that dividends are king.
Those companies that have rewarded investors with buybacks and bigger dividend payouts have had strongly performing share prices.
Nothing wrong with that.
However, the flip side of this coin is that aggregate capital expenditure is declining at a greater rate than analysts have forecast - an outcome that leads one to wonder if there is too much emphasis on short-term popularity and not enough on medium- and longer-term growth.
Sure, some companies are returning money to their shareholders and financing their businesses by other means.
For example, there is an increase in the amount of finance being obtained in the cheaper corporate bond market.
From a company's perspective, this makes sense because debt, today, is historically cheap and equity is not.
However, even if we back out the funds raised in debt markets it is clear that this generosity towards shareholders is primarily being financed by companies spending less on investment.
The net result of this wave of buybacks (and the cancelling of dividend reinvestment programs) is that the number of equities in the Australian market is decreasing.
Credit Suisse has called it the "de-equitising reporting season," in which companies are trying hard to keep their share numbers down.
As part of the same theme, companies are raising less equity.
The count from the reporting season is $3.7 billion worth of buybacks and $1.5 billion worth of expected equity raisings that did not happen.
Credit Suisse goes so far as to use the headline 'Capex is a dirty word' in one of its reports.
Although we now have the numbers to support the fact that this trend is clear, the anecdotal evidence has been with us for months.
It was sufficient for Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens to remark a few weeks ago that businesses needs a bit more "animal spirits" to push them into investment.
Stevens is not concerned about individual company's prospects but rather the aggregate impact on the economy because sluggish capital expenditure augurs badly for economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse says: "Bottom-up capex estimates have come down by an average of 4 per cent over two years for reporting companies.
Free cash-flow estimates have gone up by an average of 2 per cent.
Improving cash flow is likely to fuel further de-equitisation.
All this gives a snapshot that looks good for current shareholders and for the sharemarket, but it does suggest at least a hint of corporate expediency.
Indeed, if I had $1 for every chief executive who remarked over the years that the short-term share price was not a concern then... well, you know the rest.
Of course, this statement is a nonsense.
CEOs pay very close attention to their share price and are extremely concerned about fluctuations in it.
Their short-term and long-term bonus incentive packages are priced relative to the value of stock, and their tenure depends on it.
What they really mean is that some corporate decisions (be they acquisitions, increased organic investment or dividend payments) are not always immediately popular but they are better for medium-term strategy.
Indeed, corporate bosses regularly, and rightly, bemoan the fact that investment markets have a very short-term horizon.
This is why this current bout of conservatism feels like a cave-in to short-term interests.
For those that are assessing cheap debt markets and rationing equity, the concern does not apply, but it was all too clear in the reporting season just gone that there was a particular emphasis on rationing future capital expenditure and plenty of brownie points to be awarded for the tightest corporate wallets.
The large miners like BHP and Rio Tinto led the charge in cutting capex, but there were plenty of others; some because they needed to, but others that were just mindful of their shareholders' response.
So why are investors exerting so much pressure on companies to give them a dividend yield?
Credit Suisse strategist Hasan Tevfik says the obvious answer is that the shareholders have become more income seeking, given falling returns from traditional fixed-income products as (perversely) central banks worldwide have lowered interest rates as they flood the market with liquidity.
Thus investors have been pushed into the equity market in search of a return and, in turn, have applied pressure on companies to provide it.
Shareholders are also making it pretty clear to companies that they are nor prepared to fund what they consider risky investments, whose returns are uncertain.
They would rather have the money in their wallets as they head, increasingly, towards retirement.
The statistics from the latest reporting season clearly demonstrate that much of the earnings growth was the result of cost cutting, rather than revenue growth.
Nude celebrity picture leak looks like phishing or email account hack
The leak of pictures and, allegedly, videos of Jennifer Lawrence by an unknown hacker has security experts - and Apple - puzzled.
Though the hacker has posted a list of scores of female celebrities to a chatroom claiming to have more pictures of them, a number of those named have come forward to say that photos claimed to be of them are faked, while others claim they were deleted.
The list of those allegedly affected is long, and includes Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and the American actress Mary E Winstead.
With any hack, the principal questions are: what was the avenue of attack?
And where were the photos and videos - if they were real - downloaded from?
The most headline-grabbing possibility for the source of the photos - a full-on frontal-assault ground-up hack of Apple's iCloud service - is also the least likely.
Large companies like Apple have dedicated in-house security teams who attempt to break into their own systems regularly.
"A wide scale "hack" of Apple's iCloud is unlikely.
Even the original poster is not claiming that," noted Rik Ferguson, vice-president of security research at Trend Micro.
As with the many celebrity hacks (and daily hacks that affect less famous people), the simpler and more likely explanation is the leak of an email and password combination, either through guesswork or "phishing," when users are fooled by authentic-looking sites into entering their login details, which are then used against them.
Apple is still investigating what is claimed to be an attack on its iCloud service, which is used by iPhone users to store settings and, crucially, which backs up photos taken with the phone to "cloud" servers.
If you have a user's email address and password for their iCloud service, you can log in to their account and download those photos and other details.
The only block to that is if the account owner has enabled "two-factor authentication" (2FA) - an extra layer of security that will send a code to the owner's phone before it allows login.
Comparatively few people use 2FA, however, either because they don't know about it or find it cumbersome.
Apple is still investigating whether the data was all taken from its iCloud service and, if so, to what extent users" accounts were compromised.
The company had no statement at the time of publication.
Ferguson suggests that the hacker may have used the "forgot password" link on Apple's iCloud system after gathering the celebrities" email addresses - perhaps from the address book of another hacked device.
Alternatively, the stars used the same password on multiple services, which were captured through that.
Lawrence's publicist says the photos are real, though not how old they are.
In a tweet, Winstead suggested a longstanding effort by the hacker.
Knowing those photos were deleted long ago, I can only imagine the creepy effort that went into this.
Feeling for everyone who got hacked," she wrote.
However the independent security expert Graham Cluley points out that Winstead may have thought that she had deleted the photos from her phone - but with modern smartphones, deleting a picture from the phone does not always mean that no copies exist.
Modern smartphones routinely save photos to the cloud because they often lack enough capacity for the huge number of photos that people take.
Apple's iPhone by default saves photos to iCloud; Google's Android to its Google+ service; Microsoft's Windows Phone to its OneDrive service.
Third-party services such as Dropbox also offer automated photo and data backups.
"People take photos and zap them, but don't realise that they are being uploaded," Cluley told the Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: "Deleted doesn't always mean deleted," he notes.
Those photos and videos can remain stored for years.
If someone then gets hold of a user's email and password, they can re-download all the photos - and also any videos that might have been sent by email.
For an Apple device, the photos can be downloaded on to a Mac or Windows PC, or any Apple device.
The hacker posted a screenshot claiming to be of so-far unreleased videos and images taken on a Windows PC.
"Two-factor authentication" protects against such hacks because it requires anyone setting up a copy of an existing account on a new device to enter a code that is sent to the primary device - usually a phone.
Without that, access is blocked.
Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo all offer two-factor authentication on accounts, though it is not known how many, if any, of the affected celebrities used it.
Others have claimed that pictures allegedly of them are not authentic.
A representative for Ariana Grande said the photos said to be of her are "completely fake."
Victoria Justice also tweeted that the "so called nudes of me are FAKE people.
Let me nip this in the bud right now *pun intended*
Cluley points to another possibility.
Because those involved are celebrities, their accounts might have been hacked through someone who was handling their social media accounts or who regularly deals with their emails.
"I wonder whether the agencies or some minion might be some part of this," he mused.
However, the stars named do not share a single publicist or management agency.
Another possibility is that someone who set up one or more of the victims" systems, or helped configure one, secretly altered it so that any data would be passed back to them.
That happened in the case of the "Hollywood hacker" Christopher Chaney, from Florida, who spread photos from Scarlettt Johansson and Mila Kunis's email accounts in 2011, and was sentenced to 10 years in jail in December 2012 and ordered to pay more than $66,000 in restitution.
Chaney was accused of illegally accessing the email accounts of more than 50 people in the entertainment industry between November 2010 and October 2011; in one instance he sent an email from the account of Aguilera's stylist to the star, asking for scantily clad photos, and then posted them online.
Afterwards Chaney apologised, saying that his actions were "probably one of the worst invasions of privacy someone could experience."
It was also claimed he had stalked two people online for more than ten years.
Cluley said: "In the Chaney case, the stars had their email accounts hacked, and they were being altered so that somebody kept being forwarded their data even when the password changed."
He said that the obsessive behaviour of those who try to hack such accounts was like "butterfly collectors."
They just like to collect this stuff.
Perhaps what has happened here is that someone stumbled across a stash of these accounts and logins on somewhere like Dropbox.
Or they have been at work for a long time to get at them.
Or they hacked someone's email account and got at their address book, and then phished other people.
My suspicion is that this isn't an iCloud security flaw as such.
Australia has offered its intelligence resources to help the United Nations track down 44 peacekeepers kidnapped by al-Qaeda linked terrorists in Syria.
It's believed the 44 Fijian peacekeepers are being held by the terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusra, who overran a Golan Heights crossing last week and forced the UN troops to surrender.
They've been missing since Wednesday and their whereabouts is unknown.
The incident has deeply troubled ministers attending the UN Small Island Developing States conference in Samoa, including Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.
Ms Bishop discussed the situation with UN Secretary General Ban ki-Moon at the summit, and has offered Australia's support to rescue the missing peacekeepers.
"I've assured them that Australia is providing whatever support we can, including our intelligence resources, to assist the UN," she told AAP from Samoa on Monday.
We are keeping in very close contact with all of our partners and friends in the intelligence network ... to make sure we can locate them and they are safe.
Ms Bishop has already assured Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola that Australia would use its seat on the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
It comes amid reports that a group of Filipino peacekeepers confined to their barracks in a different part of the disputed region had escaped.
The UN has been monitoring the Golan Heights since a ceasefire between Syria and Israel in 1974.
Scammers using carbon tax repeal to steal your money, ACCC warns
SCAMMERS are taking advantage of the carbon tax repeal and trying to steal your money, the ACCC warns.
The consumer watchdog's SCAMwatch unit has issued a warning to consumers and businesses to be wary of too-good-to-be-true offers from people pretending to be from government agencies, offering thousands of dollars in compensation.
Scammers may take advantage of dollar figures being quoted in the media about how much consumers may save from changes in the price of goods following the carbon tax repeal, offering up to $7000, the warning states.
They might sound convincing too, having already researched some of your personal details and using them to convince you to hand over your bank details or pay a fee.
Scammers are using topical issues to dupe you.
It's not just the carbon tax scammers are using to seize your cash, their schemes are growing more sophisticated, using topical issues and building their scams around them.
The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and the death of Robin Williams have also inspired scammers.
The ACCC warns if you have any doubts about the identity of a caller claiming to represent a business, call the business back contacting them directly through your own search - don't rely on contact details supplied by the caller.
If you receive a phone call or email out of the blue from someone claiming to be from a government department or business such as an energy provider and they claim that you are entitled to money due to the carbon tax repeal, be cautious.
If you think you have been duped and may have given details or transferred money to a scammer, contact your financial institution immediately.
And if the offer sounds too good to be true, like the government giving your free cash, it probably is.
Taloussanomat: Lipponen criticises the EU sanctions against Russia
In an interview with Taloussanomat, the former prime minister Paavo Lipponen criticises the sanctions EU has imposed against Russia.
Russia’s focus in the politics is to pursue its own interests.
The sanctions won’t necessarily affect this,” Lipponen says in the interview.
Lipponen has started working as investigator for the businesses in Arctic regions in the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK).
He’s worried, because the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and European Investment Bank (EIB) suspended the project financing in Russia as part of the EU’s economical sanctions.
”For example, it means that the environment projects for the northern dimension, which clearly have prospects, are going to be frozen,” Lipponen says in the interview.
The freezing of the financing is going to obstruct the cooperation, the reconstruction of which might be difficult if there is no trust, Lipponen says.
However, he believes that the Finnish businesses’ interest in the Arctic Ocean cooperation projects will continue as strong as before.
Currently he’s working on a report for EK about Finland’s policy with regards to Arctic and the business opportunities in the North.
Acute situation in Ukraine or in Russia has no effect on that.
The report looks far forward, we’re talking about dozens of years,” he says.
It is rare that a ringed seal comes to shallow waters or near human settlements, says Vesa Heinonen, the nature educationalist of the Nature Centre of the Ostrobothnian Museum.
Today (Sunday), near the shore in Vaasa’s Suvilahti, a ring seal was seen swimming around.
Mr. Heinonen says that the ring seal has probably come to Suvilahti in search for food.
It’s not confused.
This means there is fish in the area, Mr. Heinonen advises.
He says that for example at the Sundom bridge, especially during spring and autumn, you can see ring seals who come there exactly because they’re following the fish.
Still, the ring seal is not a common species in the maritime zone of Vaasa.
You can see ring seals in Maksamaa, in front of the villas, he continues.
The ring seal lives for example in the northern part of the Gulf of Bothnia, and in the Archipelago Sea.
SA court told murdered pizza shop owner Robert Vallelonga was aggressive, violent outside nightclub
Murdered SA man and pizza shop owner Robert Vallelonga.
Pizza shop owner Robert Vallelonga was aggressive toward both his partner and a security guard minutes before he was killed outside a city nightclub, a court has heard.
Lawyers for Mr Vallelonga's alleged killer today asked the Adelaide Magistrates Court to release their client on bail, saying it was "clear" he had acted in self-defence.
Marie Shaw, QC, for the man - whose identity is suppressed - said the incident was insufficiently serious to warrant her client remaining behind bars until trial.
"The evidence demonstrates the deceased was engaged in aggressive conduct to the point he had to be ejected from a nightclub," she said.
After this there was an altercation resulting in one particular security guard having his shirt ripped ... by this drunken 40-year-old man.
Importantly, when the prosecution says death resulted from one punch, this evidence raises fairly and squarely the question of self-defence or defence of another.
The man, 25, has yet to plead to one count of murder.
Mr Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious with serious head injuries near the corner of Rundle St and Synagogue Place about 2.25am on May 4.
He died in Royal Adelaide Hospital, as a result of his injuries, early the next day - leaving friends and customers mourning the "local legend" of One Tree Hill.
Prosecutors have alleged the alleged killer's actions were unprovoked and, after the incident, he told a taxi driver he had "put someone to sleep for a few days."
Today, Ms Shaw said CCTV footage of the incident painted events in a different light.
"It confirms aggressive behaviour by the deceased ... his partner was trying to placate him and was herself being dealt with roughly and harshly (by him)," she said.
Our client has not only the presumption of innocence but now a positive defence of self-defence that will be put (at trial).
Prosecutors opposed the man's release, saying three security guards were present on the night of the incident and only one had complained about Mr Vallelonga.
They said the other guards were unconcerned about him as he was "short," and wrote off his verbal abuse as that of "a 100m hero" who did not want a physical confrontation.
They said a taxi driver would give evidence that, based on his "unobstructed" view of the incident, Mr Vallelonga was punched "forcefully" and had no chance to defend himself.
Magistrate Elizabeth Sheppard remanded the man in custody until next week, when she will announce her decision.
Controversial dolphin hunt begins in Japan - justified as tradition - World News - Ilta-Sanomat
Bad weather was expected to delay the beginning of the hunt which has been widely condemned globally.
The annual dolphin hunt season started again on Monday in the Japanese city Taiji.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
British newspaper The Guardian, among others, tells about the hunt which has been largely opposed around the world.
In the hunt, the hunters drive hundreds of dolphins to a remote cove, and after the most suitable ones have been selected to be taken to dolphinariums and theme parks around the world, the mammals will be slaughtered.
Dolphin meat will end up also in the food production.
However, according to the local authorities, the beginning of the hunt was expected to be delayed due to bad weather.
The practice became known globally in 2009, when “The Cove”, a documentary film about the hunt was released.
During the previous hunting seasons, the hunt has been criticised by animal rights activists, and also by diplomats.
According to the protesters, the dolphin meat has in any case limited markets due to its high mercury concentrations.
According to the promoters, including Japan’s government, the hunt is a tradition.
The supporters have also reminded that the dolphins aren’t endangered.
Demonstrations against the dolphin hunt were organised in several countries already over the weekend.
According to the protesters in Tokyo, the hunt damages Japan’s reputation around the world.
Also in Helsinki there was a demonstration in front of Japan’s embassy on Monday.
Some Nato countries uncertain about positioning new troops in eastern Europe
There are divergent opinions within military alliance Nato on whether Nato bases should be created in the eastern Europe and in the Baltics, as a response to Ukraine crisis, newspaper Financial Times reports.
Poland and Estonia have requested the military alliance to bring troops to their countries permanently, but Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has been against the plan.
“What Ukraine has done is put a new perspective Russia’s policy, and it is threatening to overturn the European security,” Michael Clarke, director-general of the Royal United Services Institute in London said to Financial Times.
Nato members will meet next week, and the military alliance’s objective is to release its new readiness action plan.
The key issue of the plan is whether Nato can breach the CFE Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces, which was signed in 1990.
In the treaty Nato and Warsaw Pact agreed on how to position armed forces in the territory between Atlantic Ocean and the Ural Mountains.
According to the Financial Times, the treaty prevents in practice new military bases in the eastern Europe and in the Baltics.
Russia itself declared a moratorium on the treaty in 2007, but the country didn’t actually dissociate itself from it.
Due to the tense situation in Ukraine, Nato is pondering whether the treaty terms still need to be abided by.
”Nato assets must be positioned in all Nato countries that require them,” Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chair of Britain’s parliamentary intelligence and security committee said to Financial Times.
Matt Guthmiller becomes youngest teen to fly around the world
At a time when most teens are starting to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned to fly.
The 19-year-old recently became the youngest pilot ever to circumnavigate the globe, and he did it alone, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
The South Dakota teenager flew 30,000 miles, making 23 stops in 15 countries on five continents.
Along the way, Guthmiller was treated like a rock star for his record-breaking flight.
He also heard what the critics had to say.
"It's too risky" or "This is some spoiled, rich brat going out and having a good time."
He said he didn't have much to say to his critics.
It was certainly a lot of fun and I had a good time, but it was a lot of work and I hope that what I did inspires other people to go out and do big things.
He was inspired to pilot a plane at an early age, first asking his parents to eat at airport cafes.
Later he pushed for flying lessons.
They agreed to let me do this little $20, 20-minute intro flight, but I think they probably thought that was going to be the end of that.
It wasn't.
He soon made a deal to get more time in the cockpit.
A little arrangement where I would share a car with my dad throughout high school instead of having my own car.
In exchange, I got to fly planes.
By the age of 17, he had his pilot's license and two years later leased a single-engine Beechcraft for his solo flight around the world.
The MIT student performed plane maintenance and his own fuel calculations.
Long hours in the air meant some additional fuel for him as well.
Basically, a lot of caffeine and Oreos.
He said he went through a few rows of Oreos during one of the long legs of his flight.
Flying into the clouds was both beautiful and dangerous.
Air traffic controllers in other countries did not have the weather radar to help him navigate around thunderstorms.
I have no idea which clouds were just a little bit higher than where I'm at and which ones go up to 45,000 feet and will break the plane apart.
He was flying a plane that was not pressurized and didn't have oxygen, so he couldn't fly above the clouds.
And with a bunch of fuel it's hard to get up any higher.
One day after our interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died after crashing his plane on what Guthmiller called the most difficult leg of his own journey -- American Samoa to Hawaii.
Guthmiller flew from the same airstrip as Suleman and said the take-off is technically challenging because of the heavy fuel load needed for the 16-hour stretch.
In spite of the risks and even a fear of heights, Guthmiller succeeded in breaking the record and raising money for computer science education through Code.org.
He is a coder himself, who started his own tech company at the age of 12.
His goals are more than sky high.
I think it would be really cool to start the next Apple, but we'll see how that goes.
He said he is aiming high.
Shoot for the stars, you can get somewhere good.
Finding the right franchisee is more difficult than you think
When a reality show about her business called The Cupcake Girls aired on the W Network in 2009, Lori Joyce was thrilled to find fans lining up at Cupcakes by Heather and Lori locations across Canada.
That is until she found out that one franchisee wasn't up to the task.
"There was a franchisee sitting in her car calling me because she has 100 potential customers lined up ready to buy a cupcake, and she couldn't handle it," said Ms. Joyce.
That was a really big eye opener for me, because it was a really big missed opportunity for us.
After that incident Ms. Joyce decided to change her franchise partner screening process, switching her focus from finding talented bakers to finding talented leaders that emanate the company's culture.
"Everyone can do a good interview... they know what I want to hear," she said, adding that she's conducted approximately 100 for each of her 11 franchise locations.
We have six weeks of training, but they behave completely differently once they're in their environment, so it's really tricky, and as a result my training really heavily emphasizes cultural fit.
Finding the right franchisee is vital for the development of any small businesses.
While a strong and honest leader can help shape and grow the organization, a poor fit can do costly damage to an established company.
"I used to think looking for a franchisee was like dating, but it's not like that at all, because when you date you can do a whole lot to get to know each other before you get married," said Ms. Joyce.
But with franchising you literally sign a franchise agreement, receive a deposit and build out a store.
It's a significant jump and a major test of trust entering that partnership with someone before seeing them perform.
Like a strong marriage, franchisors and franchisees need to enter a symbiotic relationship built on common goals, explains Lorraine McLachlan, president and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association.
She therefore believes that it's just as important for the franchisee to vet their prospective franchisor before entering such a long-term relationship.
"Just as its true in a personal relationship, if they're rude to you when you're dating, can you imagine what they'll be like when you're married?" she said.
It's equally as important for both parties to be vetting, evaluating, and paying attention to any warning flags they get from either side.
Ms. McLachlan adds that franchisors like Ms. Joyce can take what they've learned from the successes and failures of past partnerships, but first-time franchisors need to be more diligent in taking on those vital first partners.
New franchisors instead need to take the lessons of their presumably successful corporate location to determine what challenges they've had to overcome, and what skill sets franchisees will require when facing similar obstacles.
First time franchisers can also work with a franchise consultant to devise a profile based on industry norms.
Ms. McLachlan adds that there are a variety of resources for first-time franchisors and franchisees available on the CFA's website, lookforafranchise.ca.
The process gets easier over time, however, not only because franchisors become better practiced at vetting potential franchisees, but because their first few franchisors can act as an advisory board moving forward.
"The first franchise partner was very instrumental in helping Brian (Scudamore, founder and CEO of 1800-GOT-JUNK?) build the business and the franchise system," said Erik Church, COO of O2E Brands, which include 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me, and Wow 1 Day Painting.
They helped create something that Brain couldn't have created on his own, so if you're looking for your first franchise partners, think of them that way.
Mr. Church oversees 216 franchises across O2E's three brands, and is also the Toronto franchise partner of You Move Me.
When it comes to finding the right franchise partner, Mr. Church uses a very straightforward method.
"The one litmus test that's held true for us is, "would I want to invite this person over to my house for a barbecue over the weekend?"" he said.
"If the answer is "no" to that, chances are you're not going to want to spend a lot of time with them during the day working through challenging business problems."
Mr. Church adds that much of the O2E Brands" success has resulted from its franchise structure.
While managers in a corporate structure might see their position as short term and their relationship with superiors as highly formalized, franchisees buy into the business with a longer-term focus, and are therefore more vested in the success of the business.
"There are so many more upsides to having a franchise partner than having a corporate setup, but with that comes a more intensive relationship," he said.
It's not a relationship between a VP and an operations manager, it's a partnership.
It's a much more difficult relationship, but it bares much more fruit when managed well.
Rail delays knock north US grain prices
Protracted rail shipping delays have led to deep discounts for grain prices in the north central US, weeks before a huge harvest is expected to put the transport network under new stress.
Commercial silos in North Dakota are offering farmers only $2.70 a bushel for corn - about $1 less than benchmark prices - due mainly to the costs of securing capacity on adjacent tracks, traders and agricultural groups said.
IN Commodities
Problems are most acute on the BNSF, owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, and Canadian Pacific railroads.
A federal railroad regulator will hold a hearing on service problems on Thursday.
Far from river barge networks, northern plains states rely heavily on railroads to move agricultural commodities.
Rail delays lengthened after a bumper 2013 crop was followed by an extremely cold winter that slowed and shortened trains.
Some farmers suspect railroads" rising shipments of crude oil from North Dakota's Bakken shale formation have sidetracked grain, a contention railroads dismiss.
For traders storing and moving grain, the premium to secure a "shuttle train" has risen from zero to $2,000-$3,000 per car per year, an executive at an international grain trading house said.
Somebody's going to pay the cost.
"You're either going to get it from the farmer or from your customer," the executive said.
This year North Dakota's soyabean harvest is projected to expand more than a third, while its spring wheat crop will be 16 per cent bigger, the US Department of Agriculture estimates.
Randy Gordon, president of the National Grain and Feed Association, said: "Normally we try to start the harvest caught up, in terms of having available storage cleaned out and farmers" grain sold and moved.
But we're starting from behind this year because of the service disruptions that occurred last year.
BNSF has reassured customers and regulators it should handle this year's harvest smoothly.
John Miller, BNSF's vice-president for agriculture, said the company had reduced its backlog of overdue movements - orders from customers for railcars that have taken more than four days to fulfil - from a peak of 16,500 in early April to 2,000.
"We've moved almost all the old crop that wanted to move with us," Mr Miller said, referring to grain left over from the previous harvest.
The most recent reported speeds for BNSF's grain trains, however, were still 9 per cent down on last year's second quarter - an indication of congestion.
Mr Miller accepted that progress had been "uneven" but pointed out that the company was in the course of making $5bn capital investments this year to increase capacity to handle surging traffic of all kinds, including grain.
Train speeds on Canadian Pacific, the other railroad suffering serious problems because of the backlog, are down 11 per cent on the same period last year but sharply up on far lower speeds earlier in the year.
CP has told the Surface Transportation Board, the railroad regulator, that changes in its ordering system for railcars should boost its ability to handle traffic in the coming harvest by 15 to 20 per cent.
"CP's operating plan going into the fall is focused on ongoing improvement in the velocity of our trains and effective utilisation of our railcar fleet in order to deliver more cars each week," said a spokeswoman.
Ukraine crisis may solve NATO's 'identity crisis'
World leaders, diplomats and experts have often fretted about the future of NATO and whether the end of its mission in Afghanistan would also be the end of its relevance.
But as 60 leaders, including President Obama, converge on Cardiff, Wales, this week for a NATO summit, the uncertainty seems more than a little premature.
The politicians and diplomats have no shortage of world crises crowding their agenda, so many that the drawdown of troops from Afghanistan, once a top priority, has slipped down the list of most pressing.
Instead, the 28-nation alliance is being called upon to counter Russia's renewed incursion in Ukraine, a jolting reminder that threats to sovereignty in Europe are not necessarily a thing of the past.
While the leaders will be looking for new ways to punish Russia, they'll also be repositioning troops, pledging more money for military spending and recommitting to collective defense.
In some ways, NATO should thank Vladimir Putin.
"It was really searching for its purpose ... and it was having a fairly significant identity crisis," said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
And it has now not only been repurposed, it's been reinvigorated.
Obama has also added another task to the agenda.
The president says he will try to corral leaders to work toward a strategy to defeat the rapidly rising Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.
The president faces considerable challenges in rallying his war-weary allies to sign on to a military response, particularly one that crosses the border from Iraq into Syria, officials acknowledge.
But the president, who inartfully declared "we have no strategy" for defeating the extremists, is under pressure to show he is leading the world toward finding one.
Western officials have set modest expectations for breakthroughs on either Ukraine or Islamic State discussions at the summit.
The chief punishment in the pipeline for what Ukraine labeled a Russian invasion is additional economic sanctions.
European Union officials took up the issue over the weekend, but put off a decision on any new penalties.
And U.S. officials noted that Obama's key targets for cooperation on Islamic State were not necessarily NATO members.
The lineup of concerns could not have been anticipated two years ago, when the last North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit was held in Chicago and dominated by talk of the Afghanistan drawdown.
A year before that, then-Pentagon chief Robert M. Gates used his last speech in office to describe the organization as on the verge of "collective military irrelevance."
U.S. officials persistently complained of other nations falling short of their funding targets.
NATO members agree to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense, but only four countries - Estonia, Greece, Britain and the United States - met that benchmark last year.
But White House officials now say they sense a shift.
NATO members are expected to sign a pledge in Cardiff agreeing to increase spending in support of the collective defense agreement.
The details were still under discussion late last week, but the White House noted momentum behind the effort as member nations seemed to see the threats facing them in starker terms.
In light of the Russian intrusion in Ukraine, the treaty's "defense guarantees are more salient today, more urgent today than they've been at any time since the end of the Cold War," said Charles Kupchan, senior director for Europe at the National Security Council.
We are reasonably optimistic that we will get agreement among the 28 allies.
Obama will spend much of his trip reiterating that commitment to collective defense for the benefit of Russia's anxious neighbors.
The president will begin his three-day trip with a daylong stop in Tallinn, Estonia, where he will meet with leaders of that country as well as of Latvia and Lithuania.
Estonia has seen a rotation of U.S. NATO troops on its soil since Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula this year, and it's bound to get a steady stream of NATO troops under a new Readiness Action Plan set to be announced this week.
The plan aims to shorten the time for NATO forces to respond to aggression on the frontline states, officials say.
It will come with increased air policing and other visible signs of alliance protection.
The move comes with some risk for NATO, which abstained from putting permanent bases in Eastern and Central Europe, a gesture of comity toward Russia.
Officials say the new plan does not technically breach that agreement, but it may only be a semantic difference, said one Western diplomat, who would not be named discussing the plans before the formal announcement.
The word likely to be used to describe the NATO presence is "persistent," the diplomat said, rather than "permanent."
Putin’s effective ”winter weapon” – will he use it on Ukraine?
Russian President Vladimir Putin has an ace up his sleeve when it comes to Ukraine.
The West and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Mr. Putin of providing arms to the insurgents and sending Russian troops to Ukraine’s territory.
For this reason, the West has imposed sanctions against Russia.
As the situation in Ukraine has tensed up, the West is planning to impose harder sanctions against Russia.
However, Russia holds a trump card: winter is on its way, and Ukraine’s main source for energy is Russia.
According to an American authority, Ukraine’s primary energy sources are natural gas (40 percent) and coal (28 percent), Geysar Gurbanov, active at Harvard University, writes according to Business Insider.
With winter coming to Ukraine in the next under four months, and the coal mines located in the eastern part of the country ravaged by conflict, Ukrainians will freeze in their homes as their gas supplies from Russia are depleted.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, Russia’s energy giant, will help Mr. Putin to win the war eventually, Gurbanov writes.
Last year, half of the gas consumed in Ukraine came from Russia.
On July 16th, Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine due to unpaid bills.
Earlier this month, Gazprom said that Ukraine's outstanding debt for gas supplies stood at 5.3 billion dollars (approximately 4 billion euros) as of August 1st.
According to the New York Times Mr. Putin commented the upcoming winter with the following words:
I think that nobody thinks of [winter] any more, except Russia, Mr. Putin said.
There are always ways of helping resolve the issue.
First, to immediately stop hostilities, and start restoring the necessary infrastructure.
To start replenishing reserves, the necessary repair operations must be conducted and the preparations for the cold season must be made.
According to Business Insider, Mr. Putin’s comment can be interpreted as a veiled threat.
If Ukraine's army won't back down against the separatists, then Moscow might use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman of Japanese holding company Nomura noted last month that Russia's arguments for humanitarian intervention and the potential for engineering a fresh natural gas crisis in Ukraine will become stronger in a few months, if Russia can sustain the separatist militias' operations until then.
A note from Moscow has already arrived, saying that Ukraine must prepay for future gas shipments, unless Kiev begins payments on accumulated debts.
The EU is currently trying to negotiate a deal that would allow gas shipments to resume temporarily.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said last week that Russia is planning to suspend the gas shipments to the EU countries in the winter.
Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak said later that the rumours are unfounded.
He says Russia is doing every possible thing, so that gas can be supplied to EU countries.
Liberal Saudi blogger sentenced to 10 years in prison and thousand lashes
A Saudi court has confirmed the 10 year jail sentence given in May to Raif Badawi, the founder of the liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement.
The sentence includes thousand lashes and a fine of one million riyals (approximately 200,000 euros) as an additional penalty.
The rationale of the judgement was that he had set up a website which insults Islam.
Suad al-Shamari, the other founder of the organization, told AFP about the sentence on Monday.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes already in July 2013, but the sentence was appealed, and it was returned to court for a new hearing.
An appeal against the sentence was presented also in May, when also Amnesty International noted about its unfairness.
A childhood experience of Riku Rantala of ”Madventures” in Afghanistan: ”It was a truly changing human encounter”
Madventures released today a new book called "Global Explanation – the Adventurer’s Explanation to Everything”.
We asked Riku Rantala an explanation for example for the future of the world and for the differences between Indian and Finnish cultures.
Riku also tells about the most significant human encounter of his life.
Riku Rantala, an author, a journalist, the other half of Madventures, is a busy man.
A new book has been released today, there was a film picnic at the Kansalaistori yesterday, and the second season of “Docventures” starts on Yle on Wednesday.
He has been running from one place to another since the morning.
After MTV morning show taking his child to the nursery school, and from there heading to a weekly meeting.
This interview was supposed to be made face-to-face, but it had to be changed into a telephone interview.
Otherwise there’s no time.
Amidst all the rush he and Tunna Milonoff, the other half of Madventures, have had time to stop and write the book ”Global explanation” which, according to the cover text, is an adventurer’s handbook to everything.
To everything, right?
Wow, that’s a lot to promise.
The book reflects on several themes, such as what is our future like, why a certain culture succeeds less than another, why we are here and who we really are.
We took advantage of the interviews we had done over the years.
In the book, there are both professors and artists as experts.
We were working on the book actively for about a year, Riku tells over the phone to IS.
You have bit quite a big chunk to chew in the book.
What’s the key message of the book?
The message is that you must know more about the world, and that the big questions are worth contemplating, because that’s the best way for us to make it in this world.
On the other hand, the idea of the book is to be a good travel read, but it is meant to also make people discuss and share their thoughts at home as well.
The discussion can even lead to actions, Riku tells.

One of the book’s topics is the future of the world.
How does it look like?
We made a conclusion that the human race is optimistic.
Despite the climate warming and Earth’s present condition, you have to believe that at some point we will make solutions in order to improve our situation.
The Earth is like an alcoholic.
First it should admit that we have a problem, the change can take place only after that, Riku philosophises.
Riku tells that according to some studies the western humanity has reached the climax of the happiness in 1970s.
After that getting wealthier hasn’t increased our happiness.
From this we can deduce that when you have enough money and our basic needs are met, we’re happy.
Money doesn’t increase happiness.
In fact we want to instigate people to discuss about what is enough.
Exploitation of our natural resources doesn’t suffice for long if things continue like this, Riku notes.
You also discuss cultural differences in the book.
How an Indian person differs from a Finnish one?
People aren’t particularly different.
Of course, the starting points are different when it comes to education, health care and hygiene, for example.
Culturally the biggest difference is that the importance of the community is much greater in India, in a good and a bad sense.
When the West has gotten wealthier, more people are living alone.
You isolate yourself from others, and that may lead to loneliness and distress.
If we could find the right balance between community and being alone, we would be quite close to happiness, Riku tells.
Riku has met lots of different people around the world.
Which human encounter has left the biggest imprint in his mind?
It happened when I was a child, when I was on my first longer trip abroad with my family.
We lived one year in India and in Pakistan, as my father was working there for the UN.
I was 7 years old, and my two younger siblings were there too.
My brother was just a baby, Riku describes.
We returned home carried by a big moving truck.
We were driving in Afghanistan, which was ravaged by war, and on the sides of the road there was a vast amount of refugees.
A girl of my age was walking on the road, carrying her little brother in her arms.
I was sitting on the seat of a big Mercedes with a can of Coke in my hand.
Our eyes met, Riku describes.
Also a child of that age gets the situation.
It was one truly changing human encounter, which I will remember always.

Riku and Tunna at a book fair in 2013.
At that moment Riku ”twigged” that other people must be respected, even if they were significantly poorer, or even if they hadn’t the same preconditions in life as we do.
Riku grasped already at that time that money can’t be the measure of the value of a human being.
Among the adulthood memories, the people he has met in New Guinea stand out.
I couldn’t stop marvelling how traditionally people live there.
They avail themselves of the natural materials in everything, they barely use money or metallic tools.
They live in very challenging conditions.
Surviving is really hard.
It made me think.
And along the book he and Tunna want to make the people think as well.
We want the book to inspire people to read, watch and listen more.
That it would make people act, from warm lovemaking to a discussion, and even to a fist fight, Riku shoots.
The incident is being reported by the newspaper Kauhajoki.
The events started when the couple arrived at bus station, after which they called a taxi.
When the taxi started moving, a man who had been at the yard threw an object after the taxi.
The driver got out of the car, as well as the male passenger.
The man who had thrown the object stabbed the male passenger in the head, causing a life threatening wound, as well as on the hand, after which he left the scene.
The stabber is a corpulent, 170-175 cm tall man with short hair.
According to the newspaper, there has been a young, blond woman with a ponytail near the place where the event occurred.
The police wish she would contact them.
The police are also asking information from all those people who possibly have made observations of the events or of the related persons.
The stabbing took place on Wednesday, Aug 27th, around 7.50 pm.
”Hi!” said a brain to another brain – the world’s first ”telepathic” message travelled through the internet
The scientific publication PLOS ONE has published an article saying an international group of scientists has first succeeded in transmitting a message directly from one mind to another.
The first messages sent through the system were ”hola” and ”ciao”, that is ”hi” respectively in Spanish and in Italian.
In the trial setting, the emitter subject’s electroencephalographic was observed.
The emitter was trained with the program to send bits by thinking of the movement of a hand or a foot.
The imagining of the movement of the foot was coded as value 0 and moving the hands as value 1.
This data, which had been encoded in bits, was sent through the internet to the receiver subject.
A perception of a light flash was induced in the receiver with a magnetic stimulation per every coded bit value 1.
The receiver had been instructed to code the flashes as messages.
The scientist admit that this field of study is still in its infancy, but that they believe the computer aided telepathic communication will be routine activity in the not-so-distant future of the humanity.
Sanctions - Punkti - Maaseudun Tulevaisuus
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
Also the United States is tightening its own sanctions.
There is a political need for the sanctions.
It would be impossible that the EU and the US wouldn’t react, when Russia makes war in Ukraine and has invaded Crimea.
In international politics, an act is followed by a reaction, and actions are followed by counteractions.
Experience shows that all sanctions only have an effect in the long run.
Iran was persuaded to talks with regards to its nuclear program after years only.
The apartheid government of South-Africa sat glued to its chairs, even when trade was banned with UN resolutions.
Sanctions have been used against Russia, too.
During the Cold War, exporting high-end electronics or military technology to the Soviet Union wasn’t allowed.
Russia itself has set obstacles for trade for ages.
The latest was when trade of raw timber was being frozen by timber duties.
It is clear that you can’t get Russia on its knees with sanctions.
The Russians are accustomed to bad times, and Viola disappearing from the shops doesn’t create panic.
When the EU says it’s going to ban importing vodka from Russia, it’s basically a joke.
The Russians will be glad to drink that vodka themselves.
The EU sanctions are also selective.
The French can export aircraft carriers to Russia, but Finland can’t export milk.
The gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The biggest damage to Russia is not the petering out of the cheese import or the vodka export.
The biggest damage is caused by the restriction of the financial sector.
They’ll have an impact in the future only.
The Russian state will not be able to operate in the international lending markets.
It has to make payments of the old loans, but obtaining new ones is difficult.
Even though Russia has enormous foreign exchange reserves, they won’t last forever either.
The Russian businesses’ access to credit will wane, and money becomes more expensive.
Their own banks will not be able to finance all of them.
More money needs to be printed, or the businesses will have payment difficulties.
The bankruptcies are bankruptcies in Russia too, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis will continue for years, Russia’s modernisation will halt, as Renée Nyberg, a Russia specialist, wrote in Helsingin Sanomat.
It wouldn’t be the first time.
Little by little Russia would become Russia again, and it would become inward-looking.
An exceptional freestyle wrestling event organised in North Korea
Approximately 10,000 North-Koreans and a group of diplomats were attending the international freestyle wrestling games organised in the capital Pyongyang on Saturday.
The event was organised by Japanese Antonio Inoki, a freestyle wrestler who used to be a lawyer. The participants came from Japan, United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to the freestyle wrestling matches, also taekwondo matches by local athletes’ were seen.
According to Mr. Inoki, the goal of the event was to bring belligerent countries closer to each other and promote world peace through the sport.
The politics wished for improvement in the relations between North Korea and Japan in their speeches.
During the summer, Japan lifted some of the sanctions it had imposed against North Korea as a consequence of the kidnapping of Japanese persons in 1970s and 1980s.
North Korea promised to reopen the investigation of the case.
International freestyle wrestling was seen in North Korea last time in 1995.
SOK will reduce approximately 110 persons working in its consumable goods trade organisation.
The co-determination started in June, and at that time the reduction need was estimated to be up to 130 persons.
According to the company, overlapping activities have been dismantled, and the areas of responsibilities have been made clearer within the organisation.
SOK tells the actions are aimed to clearly improve the cost efficiency and the synergy between different domains.
Behind these actions is, besides the economic recession and the decline in consumer demand, also the structural change in trading, which has shaken especially the consumables goods trade.
The consumables goods trade of the S Group has been making a loss for some time.
The co-determination concerned all workers in consumables goods trade and grocery retailing, as well as the management, i.e. approximately 530 workers in total.
Turun Sanomat: part of the non-prescription medicines behind the counter
The newspaper says that between the prescription medicines and those you can pick yourself from the shelves there will be more medicines that customers can get without prescription, but only after a consultancy with the pharmacist.
According to the Finnish Pharmacists’ Association, for example the eye drops containing antibiotics could be included in the consultancy service.
After an interview with a pharmacist or a dispensing chemist, and if the pre-determined criteria are met, the medicine could be delivered over the counter, says Kirsi Kvanström, chairman of the Pharmacists’ Association in Turun Sanomat.
In Finland, there already are some medicines which are available without a prescription, but require consultancy.
One of these is the emergency contraception preparation.
Corruption under keener scrutiny
Finland will pay increasingly attention to corruption prevention.
It has been recommended by both OECD and the European Commission, as outside Finland the small amount of country’s bribing cases and sentences arouses amazement.
By the end of the year, the work group of the Ministry of Justice will discuss whether the criminal law would need sections for influence trading and abuse.
The differences between legislations emerged for example in the court hearing of the Slovenian branch of the Patria bribing case in Hämeenlinna one year ago.
Trading of influence led in Slovania to a two year prison sentence for the former prime minister, but the Finnish law doesn’t acknowledge such offence.
The anti-corruption cooperation network has tighten its cooperation in accordance with the requirements of the government program.
According to a recently completed mapping, the bribing is barely investigated in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered from University of Vaasa and The Police University College a report on propensity to corruption on different fields.
Messi suffering from a groin injury - Sports - Karjalainen
Lionel Messi, the captain of Argentina’s national football team, will miss the match against Germany on Wednesday.
Messi will remain in the stand due to a groin injury, his club Barcelona told on Monday.
Barcelona will keep Messi out as a precaution.
Messi sustained a groin injury in the league match against Villareal on Sunday.
Barcelona won the match 1-0.
Messi also missed the charity match in Rome.
Wanderers coach Tony Popovic has faith in replacements for Asian Champions League clash in Korea
Tony Popovic will be without three key players in Korea.
WITH several key members of his squad suspended for the first leg, Western Sydney Wanderers coach Tony Popovic says he won't be afraid to throw any of his players into the Asian Champions League cauldron at FC Seoul.
The Wanderers are in Dubai for a 10-day training camp, which also includes two friendly games in Abu Dhabi, to prepare for their semi-final first leg on September 17.
Due to an accumulation of yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole will all miss the trip to Korea, but Wanderers coach Popovic has faith in their replacements.
"Of course it is a loss - they've been three very important players in the ACL for us," Popovic said.
Tomi Juric got banned for this gesture in China.
It's a blow, you don't want to miss any of your players, but we missed Matty (Spiranovic) in the first game and up until now we've had Daniel Mullen injured.
Whoever comes in has done a great job and I've got full faith in the whole squad.
I won't be afraid to play anyone in that semi-final.
The Wanderers will also be without Spiranovic, who is still recovering from ankle surgery.
The Socceroos defender picked up the injury during pre-season but has resumed running and is a chance of playing in the return leg at Pirtek Stadium on October 1.
"It's on track, so he's progressing well," Popovic said.
He has his own program that he's filling and will be coming with us to Dubai, which is great news for him that he's starting to slowly get out on the field.
He's had a couple of sessions outside, which is good.
It's still a while away for us before he's fully fit, but he's progressing well.
While the Wanderers are in Dubai they will be making use of the world-class facilities on offer at the exclusive Al Sheba Sports Complex.
But Popovic says the trip is also an opportunity for his squad, which has changed significantly since the end of last season, to get to know each other better.
"We know that this will certainly help the players bond together as well," Popovic said.
We've got a lot of new players and it will be a great opportunity for them to get know each other even better on and off the field.
So we'll use that camp for various reasons.
Elite’s hamburger costs three times worker’s monthly wage
Sep 01, 2014, 9:18 pm In North Korea, the luxury of the rich households can be enjoyed, if you happen to belong to country’s elite.
Financial Times tells about the economy torn by contrasts.
The informal markets thrive in North Korea, perhaps more than ever before.
They offer to the wealthy, or to the thrifty ordinary citizens luxury, which usually isn’t connected to a dictatorial regime.
Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: only the entry fee to this recreation park is up to ten times as much as an ordinary worker’s monthly wage.
At the park you can eat hamburgers which cost 76 dollars.
That’s a 3-5 months wage for an ordinary working man in the country.
Men are drinking beer in shorts at the pool.
Life looks expensive and nice.
North Korea’s ”western markets” have their origin in the 1990s, when the country was suffering famine.
The government permits their existence, even though the prices of the goods may be outrageous at worst.
And yet, many in Pyongyang have a mobile phone which RRP is 200 dollars.
The leader Kim Jong-un, 31, may be partially to blame, as he has been trying to deliver an energetic and youthful image of himself.
During his time the government has stressed the importance of the technology in country’s development.
A journey from France to Sastamala at Turku Book Fair
The themes of the Turku Book Fair, held in the beginning of October, are France and Sastamala.
For example, writers Andrei Makine, Katherine Pancol, Gregoire Delacourt and Michele Lesbre will represent French literature.
The correspondent Helena Petäistö, who has just published her travel book, will also talk about French culture.
At the Sastamala section it is possible to visit Herra Hakkarainen’s house and enjoy the Eald Literature Days.
On the stage will appear for example Mauri Kunnas.
For example Anna-Leena Härkönen and Jari Tervo will tell about their novels.
The fair will also be spiced up by timely debates, and among the participants there are for example President Sauli Niinistö, writer Sofi Oksanen and parliamentarian Jörn Donner (Swedish People's Party of Finland).
The program manager of the fair will be President Niinistö’s spouse Jenni Haukio.
Ormiston House: Stormont Assembly hopeful of sale
The Stormont Assembly is hopeful it has found a buyer for Ormiston House, a building in Belfast that was costing the taxpayer almost £3,000 a week.
The assembly bought the 19th Century property in the east of the city 13 years ago for £9m.
While it remained unsold, it cost the assembly an estimated £400 a day on security and maintenance.
It was recently advertised at £1.25m.
It is understood the property will be used as a private residence.
The Grade B listed building was bought for £9m in 2001 to provide extra office accommodation for the assembly.
But it was later deemed unfit for that purpose.
Ten years after it was bought, the property was put on the market with an asking price of £2.5m.
It was not sold and the price was dropped.
Last year, the Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt suggested Ormiston House might provide a venue for a new international trauma centre.
But now the assembly has confirmed it is working to agree the sale of the property.
A spokesperson said a new owner would take possession of the site when legal work was concluded.
Neither the assembly nor the estate agent involved would comment on the identity of the buyer or the purchase price.
The average weekly bill for security and repairs at Ormiston House is around £3,000.
The assembly bought the property from the Police Authority, the predecessor of the Northern Ireland Policing Board.
At the start of this year, security costs at Ormiston had come to £885,641, while maintenance and running costs added up to £371,379.
Professional fees relating to repairs and maintenance added another £250,015 to the total bill, while a further £212,466 was spent on professional fees for development and planning.
The property was previously owned by the shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland who remained there until 1887, when it was acquired by his business partner William Pirrie, who later became the chairman of Harland & Wolff.
Shortly after Lord Pirrie's death in 1924, Harland & Wolff came into sole ownership of the property, selling it in 1928 to Campbell College, which held it until the mid-1970s.
”Inequality is increasing”: Helsinki to reduce education assistants
Savings aren’t being created, claims the Trade Union for the Public and Welfare Sectors JHL.
Helsinki is preparing a radical reduction in the amount of school specific education assistants.
The reduction wouldn’t concern children’s personal assistants.
The Education and Training Committee of Helsinki ended up proposing a cut of approximately 2.7 million in total to the resources of education assistants.
There are approximately 600 education assistants in total in Helsinki.
If the reductions will take place, they will be come into effect in the middle of the term, starting from the beginning of the year.
According to JHL the decision will increase inequality.
There are more and more children in need of support for learning.
However, it is unfortunately very easy to reduce assistants for saving reasons, because it hasn’t been defined clearly in the legislation how much support should be given.
There surely will not be any saving. On the contrary, the burden of the teaching personnel will increase.
For the pupils it produces a greater risk to miss the learning goals, and also the teachers’ strength will be tried, stresses Päivi Niemi-Laine, the domain director of JHL.
The plans of the city of Helsinki will produce inequality to schools, because with the future resources, small schools and the pupils in need of support will not get any assistant resources any more.
The goal of the city of Helsinki is inequality prevention.
It is exactly the educational assistants, who currently are doing the preventive work with results.
However, the adaptive measures of the Education Department target mainly this group.
All parties will suffer from this in the future.
The final resolution regarding the resources will be made in the autumn by the City Council of Helsinki, to whom I wish insight and wisdom in looking far in the future and in acting up to its goals, Niemi-Laine says.
Israel claims land in West Bank
Israeli women walk in a Jewish settlement known as "Gevaot," in the Etzion settlement bloc, near Bethlehem.
Israel laid claim on Sunday to nearly 400 hectares (1000 acres) of West Bank land in a Jewish settlement bloc near Bethlehem - a step that could herald significant Israeli construction in the area - defying Palestinian demands for a halt in settlement expansion and challenging world opinion.
Peace Now, an Israeli group that opposes the construction of settlements in the West Bank, said that the action on Sunday might be the largest single appropriation of West Bank land in decades and that it could "dramatically change the reality" in the area.
Palestinians aspire to form a state in the lands that Israel conquered in 1967.
Israeli officials said the political directive to expedite a survey of the status of the land came after three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and killed in June while hitchhiking in that area.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian who was accused of being the prime mover in the kidnapping and killing of the teenagers.
The timing of the land appropriation suggested that it was meant as a kind of compensation for the settlers and punishment for the Palestinians.
The land, which is near the Jewish settlement of Gvaot in the Etzion bloc south of Jerusalem, has now officially been declared "state land," as opposed to land privately owned by Palestinians, clearing the way for the potential approval of Israeli building plans there.
But the mayor of the nearby Palestinian town of Surif, Ahmad Lafi, said the land belonged to Palestinian families.
He told the official Palestinian news agency WAFA that Israeli army forces and personnel posted orders early on Sunday announcing the seizure of land that was planted with olive and forest trees in Surif and the nearby villages of Al-Jaba'a and Wadi Fukin.
Interested parties have 45 days in which to register objections.
The kidnapping of the teenagers prompted an Israeli military clampdown in the West Bank against Hamas, the Islamic group that dominates Gaza and that Israel said was behind the abductions.
The subsequent tensions along the Israel-Gaza border erupted into a 50-day war that ended last week with an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire.
The land appropriation has quickly turned attention back to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and exposed the contradictory visions in the Israeli government that hamper the prospects of any broader Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
Lapland’s crisis municipalities usually multi-problematic
Increasingly greater part of Lapland’s municipalities has problems, as emerges from a wellbeing research made by the University of Lapland and Lapland University of Applied Sciences.
There are no quick solutions to crisis municipalities’ problems.
Professor says reducing municipalities’ tasks by one billion euros isn’t enough.
Common elements among the crisis municipalities are for example weak municipality economy, weak employment and relocation losses.
Asko Suikkanen, professor emeritus of sociology in the University of Lapland, says there are new crisis municipalities coming from the western border and eastern Lapland.
In the survey part of the research, the inhabitants were assessing the situation of their municipality in a quite realistic way.
The inhabitants of the municipalities which did well in the research even had a pessimistic view of the prospects.
Unenthusiastic expectations affect the consumption.
People wish that the current everyday life and wellbeing would continue and that they maybe would even improve.
In these times people are afraid to make long time investments, such as buying a house, says Suikkanen.
The research group was surprised by the big differences between the municipalities.
For example, the income support expenses per inhabitant range from something like twenty euros to well over hundred euros.
The tax revenue gained by the municipality per inhabitant range from a good two thousand euros of Ranua to Pelkosenniemi’s 4,400 euros.
According to Suikkanen the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How the money is spent, how much state subsidies are being received and what is the level of the indebtedness, differ a lot between municipalities which are in similar situations, he says.

UK may close the borders from the Islamist fighters returning home
Great Britain may temporarily prevent the Islamist fighters, who have gone to Iraq and Syria, from returning home.
The news is reported by BBC, who refers to governmental sources.
However, according to the BBC, the suspected British citizens would be allowed to keep their citizenships.
A governmental source says this is one of the many proposals to be considered.
The proposal is currently being finished, and Prime Minister David Cameron is supposed to present it.
The government is also seeking for means with which it could make possible fighters’ travelling abroad more difficult.
One measure might be an extension to the authorities’ powers so, that they might temporarily seize passports of the possible fighters at the border.
UK raised the possibility of a terror threat to the second highest level on Friday.
Bob Carr welcomes the imminent release of Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor from a Libyan jail
Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor is expected to be released from a Libyan jail today.
The federal government has welcomed news Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor later today.
A spokesman for Foreign Minister Bob Carr said "all going well" the International Criminal Court lawyer will be released into the custody of Australian officials tonight and will board a plane bound for Europe by midnight.
"We welcome the news that she is likely to be released today," the spokesman told AAP from New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanks the wider international community for their help and support, the spokesman said.
Ms Taylor is likely to be taken to Rome before her onward journey to her home in The Hague.
Ms Taylor, along with three of her ICC colleagues, was detained in the Libyan city of Zintan on June 7 while representing Seif al-Islam, the son of the former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.
Libyan officials said she was found carrying documents for Seif that were judged a threat to national security.
Senator Carr has lobbied hard for her release, even visiting the Libyan capital Tripoli last month to press her case.
Ms Taylor was not able to speak to her husband and young daughter until last week.
Senator Carr said Ms Taylor was permitted to call her home in The Hague shortly after a visit by Australia's ambassador David Ritchie.
Mr Carr subsequently spoke to Ms Taylor's Brisbane-based parents John and Janelle, who were relieved to hear she was finally allowed a phone call.
Her parents had pleaded with Libya to release their daughter in time for her toddler's third birthday in July.
The three other detained ICC staffers are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Mr Carr said a week ago that talks in The Hague between the ICC and the Libyan authorities had resulted in "the ICC expressing regret, effectively an apology for any misunderstandings."
The ICC has stopped short of admitting to any wrongdoing but has said it will fully investigate its team's behaviour upon their return.
"When the ICC has completed its investigation, the Court will ensure that anyone found responsible for any misconduct will be subject to appropriate sanctions," it added in a statement issued last month.
The ICC wants to try Seif al-Islam, 39, for crimes against humanity during his father's rule, which came to an abrupt end last year.
Tripoli insists he should be tried locally and filed on May 1 a motion challenging the ICC's jurisdiction to put him on trial in The Hague.
Young newcomer saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona took its second win at the early stage of Spain’s football league, but it wasn’t easy to defeat Villarreal on its home field.
The blue-reds butted their heads against Villarreal’s goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo, until they finally succeeded on the 82th minute.
The winning goal was made by a surprising man: 19 year old striker Sandro Ramirez, who had been doing his first performance in La Liga, had entered the field only 12 minutes earlier.
The young man, who had been invited to the representative crew from Barcelona’s secondary team, finished from a close range when Asenjo had stopped Lionel Messi’s attempt.
After reaching $433,000, donations for Ferguson cop halt mysteriously
After raising more than $400,000 for the police officer who killed an unarmed black 18-year-old in Ferguson, Mo., two online donation pages appear to have been shut down by their organizers without explanation this weekend.
On the crowdsourced fundraising site GoFundMe, "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson" -- two separate pages with similar names -- have raised $235,750 and $197,620, respectively, for the Ferguson police officer who shot Michael Brown.
A similar page for Brown's family, run by the family's attorney, Benjamin Crump, had raised $314,099 as of Sunday afternoon.
The shooting triggered weeks of unrest and demonstrations against the overwhelmingly white police force in mostly black Ferguson, sending Wilson into hiding as local and federal investigations seek to determine whether he wrongfully killed Brown.
The online donation campaigns have generated some controversy for defending Wilson, especially after some visitors left racially offensive remarks in at least one of the comment sections, which have since been removed.
Both pages appear to have stopped taking donations around the same time on Saturday, and the pages' organizers did not explain why.
If a visitor attempts to donate, a message appears that says: "Donations are Complete!
The organizer has stopped donations.
In a statement provided to the Los Angeles Times on Sunday, a spokeswoman for GoFundMe said the website had not halted the donations.
"Each and every GoFundMe campaign organizer is able to decide for themselves when they would like to stop accepting donations," said the statement from GoFundMe spokeswoman Kelsea Little.
Organizers may also choose to begin accepting donations again at a later date.
The page "Support Officer Wilson," which raised $197,620, is run by a St. Louis police charity called "Shield of Hope," which has been certified by GoFundMe as a valid donation recipient.
The three officers listed on Shield of Hope's state nonprofit records, Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda, did not immediately respond to emails Sunday seeking more information about the fundraising efforts.
Zoll is a public information officer for the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a city council member for nearby Florissant, and Roorda a member of the Missouri House of Representatives.
Nor was The Times able to immediately reach the anonymous founder of the "Support Officer Darren Wilson" page, a user called "Stand Up," who has raised $235,750 and who has not been officially certified as a verified recipient on the donation page.
GoFundMe's spokeswoman vouched for the anonymous donor in a statement to The Times, however.
In contrast to the other Wilson page and the donation page for Brown, little information has been given to donors about who is running the anonymous fundraising effort.
In a message to visitors two weeks ago, the anonymous Wilson fundraiser page wrote that it was working with Shield of Hope to become a verified recipient.
That has not happened.
The fundraiser also gave out a pseudonymous Gmail account to users seeking more information, but did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.
In its statement to The Times, GoFundMe's spokeswoman said the anonymously run donation page had also been removed from its search results, adding that "this campaign no longer meets GoFundMe's stated requirement of having a valid Facebook account connected."
GoFundMe's security policies encourage users to "only contribute payments to GoFundMe users they personally know and trust.
Unfortunately there is no way to 100% guarantee that a user's GoFundMe donation page contains accurate or truthful information.
But spokeswoman Little said GoFundMe "has been in contact with the campaign organizer and has no reason to question their authenticity.
Finally, GoFundMe does possess the ability to place a hold on all donations raised by any campaign that warrants further investigation.
Nevertheless, she said GoFundMe did not place the hold.
A popular Facebook page that has been organizing pro-Wilson efforts, called "Support Officer Wilson," told followers this weekend that lawyers were working on a "solution" as to why the GoFundMe fundraisers had been shut down, but gave no more information.
The Facebook page is also run anonymously, and those remarks could not be independently verified.
Arsenal’s top striker out for the rest of the year - Premier League - Ilta-sanomat
English Premier League Arsenal’s French striker Olivier Giroud is probably out of the games until the end of the year.
Giroud’s ankle was operated on Wednesday, and the recovery will take months.
Giroud hurt his leg in a Premier League match against Everton in the weekend.
The operation went well, but he’s out until he will be able to play on the top level, through the end of December or the beginning of January, said Arsene Wenger, Arsenal’s head coach, to Sky Sports.
With his 16 hits, Giroud was Arsenal’s best scorer in the last season, so the loss is tangible.
However, Wenger says he won’t necessarily get anyone to replace Giroud during this transfer window.
Wenger had a fresh acquisition, Alexis Sanchez, play in the up front on Wednesday in the Champions League final qualifying match against Besiktas.
Arsenal won 1-0 with Sanchez’s goal.
Nude pictures of Hollywood celebrities are circulating the web - hacking suspected
Images, which were allegedly nude photos of several public personalities, were circulating social media on Sunday.
In the pictures there were for example Oscar winning actress Jennifer Lawrence and pop star Rihanna.
According to a US media source, the photos are suspected to have ended up as target of a wide hacking case.
The media source says the photos would have been stolen from Apple’s iCloud accounts.
“It's so weird and hard how people take your privacy away from you,” Lawrence tweeted.
According to the media source, in the photos there were also for example actress and model Jenny McCarthy, reality TV performer Kim Kardashian, as well as singer and actress Avril Lavigne.
Singer and pop star Ariana Grande’s publicist says the photos in which she allegedly is, are fake.
Singer Victoria Justice said the same.
Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who has been acting in horror films, said the intimate photos of her are years old.
